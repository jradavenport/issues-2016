Reform & Growth

READ MORE
Under President Obama, Americans have now endured six years of tax increases, endless regulation, vast new federal programs and $8 trillion in added debt. The president told us this “stimulus” would jump-start the economy. Instead, we got an anemic economy growing at barely 2% a year. Some call this “the new normal”—but it isn’t something we can accept if we are going to restore the opportunity for every American to rise and achieve earned success.

Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can’t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.

Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can’t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.

Today, the tax code is a labyrinth littered with thousands of special-interest giveaways, subsidies and other breaks written to favor Washington insiders. At 80,000 pages, it’s a tax code only an army of tax accountants and lobbyists could love—because they’ve written it.

The code is rigged with multiple carve-outs for favored industries. It penalizes people for moving up the economic ladder. It gives tax deductions for borrowing costs, thereby encouraging companies to take on too much debt and raising concerns about financial fragility, rather than having them focus on real investment and hiring.

Low growth, crony capitalism and easy debt—that’s President Obama’s economic agenda in a nutshell, and the tax code has helped make it possible. It’s past time for a change.

In early September I unveiled the plan that, as president, I will submit to Congress and sign into law as the Reform and Growth Act of 2017. My plan centers on accomplishing three major goals:

First, I want to lower taxes and make the tax code simple, fair and clear. It should be easy to understand and make it easy for people to fill out their own tax forms.

We will cut individual rates from seven brackets to three: 28%, 25% and 10%. At 28%, the highest tax bracket would return to where it was when President Ronald Reagan signed into law his monumental and successful 1986 tax reform.

With this reform in place, roughly 15 million Americans will no longer bear any income-tax liability. The plan nearly doubles the standard deduction now taken by roughly two-thirds of all filers. It eliminates the marriage penalty, expands the Earned Income Tax Credit, ends the death tax, retires the Alternative Minimum Tax and ends the employee’s share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers older than 67.

Second, I want to eliminate the convoluted, lobbyist-created loopholes in the code. For years, wealthy individuals have deducted a much greater share of their income than everyone else. We will retain the deductibility of charitable contributions but cap the deductions used by the wealthy and Washington special interests, enabling tax-rate cuts across the board for everyone. And while we’re doing that, we will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won’t be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains.

Third, I believe that the tax code should no longer be an impediment to the nation’s competitiveness with China, Europe and the rest of the world. Liberals will tell you that we need walls and tariffs to protect U.S. businesses from international competitors. The liberals are wrong; we need tax reform. To stop American companies from moving out of the country, I will cut the corporate tax rate from 35%—the highest in the industrial world—to 20%, which is five percentage points below China’s.

Graphs-Quotes-14
We will end the practice of world-wide taxation on U.S. businesses, which fosters the insidious tactic called corporate “inversions.” This is when small overseas companies buy big U.S. companies so that both can enjoy the lowest tax rate possible, costing American jobs and revenue. And we will assess a one-time tax of 8.75%, payable over 10 years, on the more than $2 trillion in corporate profits sitting overseas.

We will also allow businesses to fully and immediately deduct new capital investments—a critical step to increase worker productivity and wages. To pay for this, we will eliminate most corporate tax deductions—which is where favor-seeking and lobbying are most common—and remove the deduction for borrowing costs. That deduction encourages business models dependent on heavy debt.

When we accomplish these big reforms, the result will be a much simpler, leaner and fairer tax code.

I know that enacting these policies works because I’ve done it before. As governor of Florida, I cut taxes every single year—returning a total of $19 billion to Floridians. The state’s economy took off, growing at an average rate of 4.4%. Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by an average of $1,300. Florida’s pro-growth climate created 1.3 million new jobs. And we did it all while balancing the budget eight years in a row and increasing the state’s rainy-day fund by $8 billion.

Graphs-Quotes-12
By focusing on tax reform like I did in Florida, America can grow faster, too. But tax relief and reform is only part of what we must do. We still have to reduce the regulations that choke so much of the U.S. economy, especially farms, factories and power plants. We have to fix the broken immigration system so that it helps drive a growing economy. We have to take full advantage of America’s energy revolution. Finally, we have to transform the education system so that all children are prepared to succeed in college and at work, and participate fully in the economy we’re trying to build. Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.

Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.

To achieve these policies, we have to change the way Washington works. And we have to change who we send there to lead. That’s what my economic plan will achieve, and that’s why I’m running for president.

Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Reforming Washington

READ MORE
We used to call this city “Mount Tallahassee” because it was so remote from the people, so caught up in the settled ways of a comfortable establishment. I was a governor who refused to go along with that establishment. I wasn’t a member of the club, and that made all the difference


Should I win this election, you will not find me deferring to the settled ways of “Mount Washington,” either. The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in that city – these problems have been with us so long that they are sometimes accepted as facts of life. But a president should never accept them, and I will not. We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital – and I mean to do it.

“We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital – and I mean to do it.”

Balanced Budget Amendment

From the very outset as president, I would signal a new direction by supporting fundamental reforms that go to the heart of the problem.

First, we have to confront and end the habitual practice of deficit spending. As long as deficits are an option, deficits will be the reality. The remedy that I will support as president is a balanced budget amendment. To be clear, a properly-designed amendment must be a tool to limit government – not raise taxes.

Americans in every party are right to be worried about the fiscal integrity and solvency of our government. It needs to be fixed. I will urge Congress to submit a balanced budget amendment to the states and let the people decide.

Second, it’s time to revive Veto Corleone. The president should be able to eliminate wasteful spending through a constitutionally sound line-item veto – such as the version that Congressman Paul Ryan has proposed.

Overspending is one of those problems where a president has to assert the national interest, even if no one else will.  The power to veto irresponsible spending is part of that duty, and I know how to use it.

Automatic Government

Too much in the federal government runs on automatic – which usually means that things are happening with no one stopping to ask why. We see this in the way the civil service operates. People are hired, promoted, and given pay increases often without regard to performance.

More than ever, it’s a system stuck in old ways, ruled by inertia, and unaccountable to the people. And with over two million employees on the federal payroll, these problems carry a heavy cost, and a few serious reforms will go a long way.

My first reform will be placing a freeze on federal hiring. We can expect more than 10 percent of the current federal workforce to retire over the next 5 years. It’s a fairly safe bet that not everyone who leaves has to be replaced.

04PV3RScreen Shot 2015-07-19 at 9.26.24 AM
We will go by a simple three-out, one-in rule across the federal workforce, with exceptions for critical positions related to our security and safety. Only one new hire for every three who leave.

This policy can, on its own, reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent within 5 years.

Combined with other reforms, reducing the size of the bureaucracy by 10 percent within 4 years is a realistic goal, saving tens of billions of dollars, and without adding to unemployment.

There are a lot of exemplary employees in the federal government, but they’re treated no better than the bad ones.  And the bad ones are almost impossible to effectively discipline or remove.

Job security is one thing, job entitlement is another, and every time a federal employee needs to be moved along it shouldn’t be a federal case.

I will also propose, along with merit pay, enhanced financial incentives for managers whose skill and careful planning actually reduce spending.

When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it – and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.

“When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it – and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.”

Setting the Standard

In all of these reforms, it matters what example is set by those in elective office. It’s easy for elected officials to lay out standards of performance for others. But what are high standards worth if we don’t apply them to ourselves? Consider a pattern in Congress of members who sometimes seem to regard attendance and voting as optional – something to do as time permits.

The reality is that Congress is in session for three days in a typical week anyway, so it’s not asking too much that every member be there and work on those days. And if it’s an incentive they need, how about the one that pretty much every worker in America has in their job: you don’t show up, you don’t get paid for that time.

A bill to dock the pay of absentee members might not pass the House or Senate, but at least it would get them all there for a vote.  If we can’t always get them on the job, let’s at least get them on the record.

If I learned anything as Governor of Florida, it was never to take time for granted. I even kept on my desk, where I would always see it, a digital clock counting down the time left in my term to the last hour. I might just bring that clock along, should I have the honor of serving the 1,461 days of the next presidential term.

“Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year.”

But this era of excuses is drawing to an end. There’s some lost time to make up, and we can do it. Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year. Balanced budgets, and debt that is finally under control, are also within our power to accomplish. And the driving force must be a presidential-level challenge to the culture of spending. This is essential and achievable in a single term – and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Defeating ISIS

READ MORE
Thank you very much.  It’s good to be with all of you, and I appreciate the kind hospitality of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

I bring greetings from the wonderful guy who is still very proud to have been Ronald Reagan’s vice president. A competition turned into friendship, and the better my Dad got to know Ronald Reagan, the more he admired and loved him.  On my way here this afternoon, I made a call to Nancy Reagan, to thank her for this honor and let her know how much we all love her.

Seven elections have come and gone since the Reagan name was last on the ballot.  Yet in many ways, that name, and the qualities it brings to mind, is still the standard.  A leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words, it was President Reagan who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace. Strategically and morally, he conceded nothing to America’s enemies.  He believed that the Cold War could be won, not just endlessly managed, and in the end he put an age of conflict behind us.  They don’t always give out peace prizes for that, but peace is what Ronald Reagan left behind, and that is the legacy of a good and great man.

In our time as well, it is strength, and will, and clarity of purpose that make all the difference.  Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes.  We’ve seen in recent years how critical each one of these principles is to our security, because when it counted most, they were missing.

Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes.

To really grasp what the next president will face, we have to look candidly at a few policies that have gone very wrong in these years –above all, in what we used to call the global war on terror.  Despite elaborate efforts by the administration to avoid even calling it by name, one of the very gravest threats we face today comes from radical Islamic terrorists. The terrorists are possessed by the same violent ideology that gave us 9/11, and they are on the offensive and gaining ground.  It is not true, and was wishful thinking by the Administration to claim, that ‘the tide of war is receding.’

The reality is that radical Islam has been spreading like a pandemic – across the Middle East, throughout Africa and to parts of Asia, even in the nations of the West, finding recruits in Europe and the United States.

Here’s another stark reality: Seven years ago, the long-awaited jihadist caliphate existed only in the fevered imagination of the terrorists.  Today, the radicals’ caliphate exists as an actual place, occupying a stretch of land larger than Indiana.


ISIS, a genocidal terrorist army, controls large parts of two countries, and is gaining influence in others.  And yet well into this nightmare, President Obama’s administration, by its own admission, has no strategy to stop it.  In place of one, they are pursuing a minimalist approach of incremental escalation. The results have been a creeping U.S. involvement, without any strategic results – the worst of both worlds.

A year of limited strikes and other half-measures has made little discernible difference in the sum total of the ISIS danger. A halting, ineffective effort against them has only emboldened these terrorists, leaving the pandemic unchecked.

Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, and other cities that American and allied troops died to liberate, are now under the black flag of ISIS.  Inside the caliphate, non-believers are forced to convert, and those who do not, can expect a horrible fate. A special hatred is reserved for Christians and other religious minorities.  In the Middle East today, we are witnessing a mass persecution and exodus of the followers of Jesus Christ.  Nor is any allowance made for adherents of Islam found lacking in zeal by ISIS, which has filled mass graves with innocent Muslims.

Potential recruits of ISIS, ready for their own taste of violence, can even follow it all on social media. It’s a time when mass murderers have Twitter handles, Facebook and Instagram pages, using these to add a veneer of glamor to their exploits.  We need to work with the owners of the relevant companies, and give careful thought to how we address this problem.

Among followers worldwide, ISIS is hailed as the strong horse, the glorious cleanser and restorer of Islam, and that word is getting out on Western-based social media.  This helps explain the spread of ISIS and the terrorist pandemic in the Middle East and beyond, including thousands recruited from Europe, and more than a hundred from America, giving us ISIS terrorists with Western passports.

The Islamic State and its followers are an asymmetric threat –needing just one big strike to inflict devastation. What we are facing in ISIS and its ideology is, to borrow a phrase, the focus of evil in the modern world.  And civilized nations everywhere, especially those with power, have a duty to oppose and defeat this enemy.

No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially.  Yet in a long experience that includes failures of intelligence and military setbacks, one moment stands out in memory as the turning point we had all been waiting for.  And that was the surge of military and diplomatic operations that turned events toward victory.  It was a success, brilliant, heroic, and costly.  And this nation will never forget the courage and sacrifice that made it all possible.

So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary?  That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill – and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.  ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat.  And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this?  Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.


Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton – the storied ‘team of rivals’ – took office?  So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers.  It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else’s problem.  Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.

All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone.  Another terrible miscalculation, unfolding right now, is a different story.  That would be the Obama-Clinton-Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force in the region when in fact they are deceitful dictators causing nothing but instability.

Whenever bad things happen in the Middle East, from Israel’s borders to the shores of Yemen, the influence of the mullahs is rarely far from the scene.  Here is a regime that supports terrorism, threatens to destroy Israel, has for years been trying to develop nuclear weapons, routinely commits human rights violations, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq, and even now is unlawfully detaining American citizens.

Iran, its ally Assad, its terrorist proxy Hizballah, and the sectarian militias it sponsors have fueled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, that have helped give rise to ISIS. Yet the president’s deal with Iran confronts none of these problems.  And least of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.  In fact the deal prepares the way for that capability. With the lifting of sanctions, the deal also frees up more than 100 billion dollars for Iran’s security services to use as they wish.  In effect, the primary investors in a violent, radical Middle East have just received a new round of funding, courtesy of the United States and the United Nations.

And, this is President Obama’s idea of a diplomatic triumph. It is a deal unwise in the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme. It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America.

It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America.

If the Congress does not reject this deal, then the damage must be undone by the next president – and it will be my intention to begin that process immediately. Knowing what has gone wrong, however, is not the same as knowing how to set it right.

The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity, and confidence that only American leadership can provide.  Radical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming, and I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected President of the United States.  We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace.  Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail.

In all of this, the United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the most populous Arab country and the wealthiest, are important partners of the United States.  Those relationships have been badly mishandled by this administration.  Both countries are key to a better-coordinated regional effort against terrorism.  We need to restore trust, and work more closely with them against common threats. We have very capable partners, likewise, in the United Arab Emirates, who are willing and able to take the fight to the extremists.  We have a moderate and quite formidable leader in King Abdullah of Jordan.  We have an ally in the new democratic government in Tunisia, and a fragile democracy in Lebanon – nations that are both under assault by radicals and terrorists.  Across the region, responsible governments need no persuading of what the moment requires.

It requires action, coordination, and American leadership to bring it all together.  My strategy meets the unique circumstances in each of the two countries, Iraq and Syria, in which ISIS now has territory.  And let’s start with Iraq, and the five broad actions I would take as president to help remove the threat from that country.

IraqStrategy_New1
First, we must support the Iraqi forces, which right now have the will to win, but not the means.  As matters stand, the United States has been helping to reconstitute Iraqi security services and to aid the Kurdish peshmerga.  We need to broaden and expedite our efforts to help ensure Iraqis rebuild their security sector – not only to win against ISIS, but to break free of Iranian influence.  And that effort should also involve even greater engagement with the Sunni tribes, whose fighting units served side-by-side with Americans to defeat al-Qaeda-in-Iraq and were then disbanded by the Maliki government.

IraqStrategy_New2
Second, we must give these forces the consistent advantage of American air power, to cover their operations and to strike with fierce precision.  The strategy has to include forward air controllers, whose skill and accuracy would severely hinder the enemy’s freedom of movement.  This would greatly improve the ability of fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to provide necessary close air support to local ground forces. ISIS fighters try blending into the civilian landscape.  Our spotters on the ground will enable us to hit them hard and rarely miss.

IraqStrategy_New3
Third, we must make better use of the limited forces we have by giving them a greater range of action.  Right now, we have around 3,500 soldiers and marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed.  We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces.  But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country. Our unrivaled warfighters know that it is simply not enough to dispense advice and training to local forces, then send them on their way and hope for the best.  Canadian troops are already embedded in Iraqi units to very good effect.  Our soldiers and marines need the go-ahead to do that as well, to help our partners outthink and outmaneuver the enemy.

IraqStrategy_New4
Fourth, we should providemore support to the Kurds, giving them decisive military power against ISIS.  In Iraq’s Kurdish region, we have loyal friends and brave and skilled fighters.  If I am commander in chief, the United States will make certain that the Kurds have everything they need to win.

IraqStrategy_New5
And finally, our strategy in Iraq has to restart the serious diplomatic efforts that can help that country move in the right direction.  Only Iraq’s Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can decide if they will live together and share power and resources in a way that will serve their interests, assuring the survival of their country.  But these partners have to know that while the United States is there in measure, we are also there in earnest and for the long haul.  They will come through for their country, but they’ve got to be certain that we have their back.

Now, the situation in Syria is quite different from the one in Iraq.  In some ways, it is even more complex because we have no large, cohesive force to work with.  And here, too, we have seen what ruin and suffering can follow when America doesn’t lead.

Of 23 million Syrians, about 11 million have been displaced or fled the country altogether.  More than two hundred thousand people have so far been killed in the mayhem.  The regime of Bashar al-Assad is deploying every ruthless means to stay in power.  Long brutalized by that regime, now under assault from ISIS, Syrian moderates want to fight against both enemies, and they view the regime as the greater evil.  It’s a sorrowful picture when you think back on how it could have been avoided.

Exactly four years ago, we heard words that still hang in the air of the Middle East – when President Obama declared that ‘the time has come for President Assad to step aside.’  Then, three years ago, came another pronouncement – that any use of chemical weapons by Assad would be a ‘red line,’ inviting tough consequences for the regime.

If the choice was between silence and these idle, grandiose words, it would have been better to say nothing at all.  What followed is that Assad used those weapons, again and again, and there were no serious consequences whatsoever.  Having lost our credibility on such an epic scale, it is hard to get it back.  But we had better try, because the longer we do nothing, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and the more directly our friends and our interests are threatened.

Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse.

Our ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long-term political stability in that country.  Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its plan-less aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi.  Syria will need a stable government, and a transition free of more sectarian blood-letting will depend on the credible moderate forces we help unite and build up today.  To that end, my strategy would bring American influence to bear in four all-important areas of action.

SyriaStrategy_New1
First, a coordinated, international effort is essential to give Syria’s moderate forces the upper hand.  As it is, the Qataris, the Turks, the Saudis, and others have been supporting fighting groups in Syria.  But these groups are not always working to common purpose.  And if there’s anything that moderate forces in Syria cannot afford right now it’s confusion and disunity.

Under my strategy, the aim would be to draw the moderates together and back them up, as one force.  And we should back that force up all the way through – not just in taking the fight to the enemy, but in helping them to form a stable, moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone.  It’s a tough, complicated diplomatic and military proposition, even more so than the current situation in Iraq.  But it can be done. We saw in the Iraq surge how Islamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces.  And the strategic elements in both cases are the same – we have to support local forces, and we must stay true to our word.

SyriaStrategy_New2
Second, we have to expand and vastly improve the recruitment and training of Syrian forces fighting ISIS.  At the moment, too many in Syria doubt that they can count on us, which explains why our recruiting and training have basically come to nothing.  When a five hundred million dollar program gets you 54 recruits, you know the plan’s not working out.  The reality is, our recruitment efforts have been failing in Syria because we are not respected anymore as a reliable actor in the region.  And we have to change that impression with the kind of clear, consistent, and credible action that every nation should expect from the United States of America.

SyriaStrategy_New3
Third, we must over time establish multiple safe zones in Syria.  It’s a measure of progress that we have joined with the Turks to create a small, ‘ISIS-free zone’ in the northern part of the country.  But we need to go beyond well this, by establishing safe zones to protect Syrians not only from ISIS, but also from Assad.

SyriaStrategy_New4
Fourth, we and our partners should declare a no-fly zone in Syria, and then work to expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime.  Enforce that no-fly zone, and we’ll stop the regime’s bombing raids that kill helpless civilians.  It could also keep Iranian flights from resupplying the regime, Hizballah, and other bad actors.  A no-fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it.

When we talk about no-fly zones in Syria, precision airstrikes in Iraq, or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats, all of this assumes that such power is there when we need it. Yet here as well, the shortsightedness of the present administration will leave a cost.  We are in the seventh year of a significant dismantling of our own military, in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying.  And I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America.

A winning strategy against the Islamic State, or against any threat to ourselves and our friends, depends ultimately on the military strength that underwrites American influence.  Let that slip away, and what would America be in world affairs, except one more well-intentioned voice at the United Nations?  In any effort of ours to overcome violence and secure peace, a winning strategy depends on maintaining unequaled strength, and we can never take it for granted.

I might add that this includes strength among our intelligence services, military and civilian.  No men and women receive so little credit for doing so much to track dangers and keep us safe.  These skilled and brave Americans can be sure of this: If I become commander in chief, they will receive the tools they need and the gratitude, respect, and support they deserve.

A good many people who serve in our military and intelligence agencies are at mid-career.  And I venture to guess that for quite a few of them, their calling has something to do with their coming of age in the Reagan years.  Yet any nostalgia for that time has to recall, not only a falling wall and collapsing evil empire, but also the fear, and tension, and dead-serious challenges that could all have played out so very differently.  From the distance of decades, even the greatest successes in security and foreign policy can look almost inevitable.  Of course, nothing had to happen as it did.  Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it.  But then along came, one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most.

It’s that way for us too, in having to deal with long conflicts and serious threats that are again on the offensive.  And in living up to our responsibilities, we can always use a little more of the Reagan spirit – rejecting with contempt the idea that conflict must be endless, or that the spread of danger and violence is inevitable.  It is not.

For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace.  This is the way forward in our time as well, led by a president who is resolute – as I will be – in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears.

For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace.

We can protect our people, put adversaries back in retreat, get things moving our way again, and win back the momentum for freedom’s cause.  In all of this, let us never forget that in fighting evil, we are doing good; in stopping the merciless, we are delivering justice; and in destroying the violent, we are defending the innocent.

This is the work that America is in this world to do.  Let us meet that duty with confidence, faith, and resolve.

Thank you very much.

Border Security

READ MORE
When Clint Bolick and I published Immigration Wars in 2013, we presented a number of proposals to strengthen America’s immigration policy. Border security and the interior enforcement of immigration laws, including a greater role for states, formed key parts of this package of reforms. We emphasized that finding a practical solution to the status of the people who are here illegally today is a nonstarter if our borders are not secure against future illegal immigration.

I believe that for those already in the country, we need to put in place a rigorous path that requires individuals to pass a thorough criminal background check, pay fines, pay taxes, learn English, obtain a provisional work permit and work, not receive federal government assistance, and over an extended period of time earn legal status. But any plan to address the status of illegal immigrants must be accompanied by a robust strategy to improve border security.

Securing the border is possible, but it will require Washington to move beyond divisive rhetoric. The following six proposals offer concrete steps that the federal government should take to help secure the border and enforce our immigration laws. We must transform immigration from a broken system into one that benefits every American.

Border Security

1. A forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats.

In some cases, it takes Border Patrol agents over an hour to get to the remote and rugged areas they need to patrol. Creating more forward-operating bases maximizes agents’ time on the border by stationing them there (much like a fire station) for multiple days at a time. We also have to interdict drugs and people as close to the border as possible by using quick reaction teams that go after the threat the moment it crosses the border. An approach to border security that waits until illicit traffic is miles into the interior of the country effectively cedes sovereign U.S. territory to the cartels and smugglers. These forward-leaning Border Patrol agents should be at the front line of a multi-layered “defense in depth” where additional lines of defense increase the likelihood of detecting and apprehending illegal crossers.

The Border Patrol also must have the flexibility to deploy resources as needed. The flow of illegal immigrants can and will shift over time. For example, in the mid-2000s, the Tucson, Arizona sector saw the most traffic based on the number of apprehensions; after we applied more resources, people went to less secure areas of the border, such as the Rio Grande Valley sector in South Texas. Our border security posture must be as nimble as the cartels’ ability to shift operations to a different area.

2. Use new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border.

Having the ability to detect illegal crossings is necessary to secure the border. In order to apprehend a person, you first have to know when and where a crossing occurs. That is one of the biggest problems right now—we do not have enough surveillance on the border and we are being beaten without knowing it. We can leverage technology to constantly watch the border, develop intelligence, and put our agents and resources where they are most effective at preventing and apprehending illicit border crossers.

Technology, such as drones, advanced sensors, and radar, can give our agents a fuller picture of the illegal activity that in turn will enable the country to better allocate resources on the border. More than that, technology can make securing the border safer for our agents who will not have to respond to false alarms. And because the cartels do extensive counter-surveillance on our agents through the use of spotters who report on the movement of the Border Patrol, we need to keep them guessing by using mobile technology.

3. Bolster border infrastructure and improve access to federal lands.

Road construction and maintenance can provide agents access to areas of the border that would otherwise go unpatrolled. New roads are needed on the border to secure access to remote and rugged terrain to interdict smugglers, and respond to the detection of illicit traffic by technology. Likewise, new boat ramps can provide Border Patrol riverine units more points to put their vessels in the water so they can patrol more effectively.

As noted in Immigration Wars, fencing is a component of border security. When combined with surveillance technology and agents to detect and respond to crossings, fencing or other barriers can serve several purposes, including: (1) deterring illegal entries by making it more difficult to cross the border, (2) facilitating enforcement by increasing the time available to respond and apprehend people, and (3) steering dangerous criminals and traffickers away from populated areas, improving public safety. Sufficient funding should be provided to maintain, improve, and expand fences where appropriate (e.g., based on the terrain along the border or the proximity of populated areas).

Access to federal lands is another key part of improving access to border areas. Currently, agents have to navigate byzantine environmental rules and regulations to access federal lands, which make up a large portion of the southwest border. Removing these restrictions would help untie the hands of our agents to patrol every inch of the border.

Interior Enforcement

4. Require electronic verification of employment eligibility.

Many illegal immigrants come to the United States for jobs and, despite the prohibition on hiring illegal immigrants, they are hired in large numbers. If we decrease the likelihood of being employed, crossing the border will be less rewarding. However, the current I-9 system does not effectively prevent the hiring of illegal workers. We need a strong E-Verify system to ensure that American businesses are not hiring illegal immigrants. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. Employers should not be penalized if they use E-Verify in good faith and receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. Identity theft protections are also necessary. Finally, with an improved E-Verify, the government must enforce penalties for violations.

5. Identify and send home the people who are entering the United States and overstaying their visas or otherwise violating the terms of their admission.

In its widely-cited 2006 review, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that nearly half of all illegal immigrants living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport and overstayed their visas. While we need to find a practical solution to the status of people who are here illegally today, as we secure the border going forward, we also need to identify and send home the people who enter the country legally but overstay their visas or otherwise violate the terms of their admission.

Unfortunately, without a system in place to track adequately who has actually left the country, it is difficult to know who these individuals are. A biometric exit system must be rapidly implemented so that immigration and national security officials know with certainty who is, and is not, in this country.

We also need to increase federal resources dedicated to overstay enforcement. In FY 2012, the federal agency that investigates overstay cases, among other activities, spent less than 2 percent of their time on these cases.

Furthermore, we need to create intergovernmental task forces to locate and apprehend overstays, especially those who present public safety risks. With proper training and supervision, state and local police could augment federal agents because they know their communities and have more boots on the ground.

6. Crack down on sanctuary cities that undermine efforts to enforce immigration laws.

We should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws and make sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. We should also expand federal partnerships that train state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, particularly in jails and prisons. When I was Governor of Florida, the state was a trailblazer in working with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. In 2002, Florida signed the first agreement with the federal government under the Section 287(g) program, which trains state and local police to help enforce immigration laws.

These six proposals, when combined with a rigorous path to earned legal status, would realistically and honestly address the status of the 11 million people here illegally today and protect against future illegal immigration. While passions run high on this issue, there is no rational plan to deport millions of people that the American people would support. It would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The policies I am advocating can ultimately receive bipartisan support in Congress and become law. President Obama has had six-and-a-half years to address our broken immigration system. Instead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country. One has to ask whether he is more interested in providing a wedge issue for his party than offering a solution for the country. There should be no doubt where I stand. I am committed to addressing the problem of illegal immigration in a comprehensive fashion so we can respond to the legitimate concerns of the American people and build stronger support for legal immigration, which if done properly can be a catalyst to bring us to strong, sustained economic growth that will benefit every American.

At the core of America’s military strength are the men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. We have no greater asset than our service members or greater responsibility than ensuring they are well provided for – while they are in uniform and throughout their lives.

Recent revelations of grave conditions at facilities throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system have brought to light the failed leadership of the Obama Administration to serve those who have served our nation.


Reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), fixing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and improving services to veterans across the board must be a top priority for the next President of the United States.

Jeb’s Florida Record:

Florida has the third largest veterans population in the country. As Governor, Jeb made military families and veterans a signature issue. He increased the number of state veterans’ homes from two to six. He increased property tax exemptions for disabled veterans (from $500 to $5,000) and eliminated the fee to get a disabled parking permit. Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature created an employment advocacy and assistance program for military spouses and dependents.

He also passed laws that provide free undergraduate tuition at state colleges and universities to Florida recipients of the Purple Heart (and combat-related decorations ranked superior in precedence to the Purple Heart) and their children.

Jeb can reform veterans’ services and care and expand opportunities for them because he’s done it before.

Jeb can reform veterans’ services and care and expand opportunities for them because he’s done it before.

Jeb’s Seven-Step Plan to Keep America’s Promises to Our Veterans:

• Improve the Veterans Health Administration by Enhancing Care and Expanding Veterans Choice
• Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality Services
• Modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs
• Create More Opportunities for Veterans
• Restore Military Troop Levels
• Improve Healthcare for Female Veterans
• Honor Veterans’ Service

Overhaul the Veterans Health Administration to Expand Veterans’ Choices and Enhance Care

Taxpayers entrust the Veterans Health Administration to care for our returning warriors. Unfortunately, the VA is long overdue for reform and a recommitment to its core mission. Veterans should be treated by a doctor and at a clinic of their choosing, not at the discretion of federal bureaucrats. Those who choose to use the VA system must have timely access to top-notch medical services.

Jeb’s Plan

Currently, only certain veterans are allowed to choose their doctor – those who can’t get an appointment within 30 days and those living 40 miles or more from a VA health facility. That number should be broadened and limitations to private access reduced. If a veteran wants to see a neighborhood physician, he or she has earned that choice. The VA must remain the guarantor of that choice and that care.


The challenge in expanding the choice program is in the cost and outreach. Approximately 30,000 veterans have opted to use the program, a paltry number given the nearly 9 million veterans who use VA hospitals. Though the program is still new, the VA has not sufficiently encouraged veterans to participate. Cost is also a problem. Although total VA funding grew by nearly 73 percent since 2009, the VA ran out of money in 2015. While it is unconscionable that the VA still can’t afford to provide reasonable options for veterans, the fact remains that choice is expensive and there needs to be a way to pay for it.

With budgetary concerns in mind, increasing choice cannot come at the expense of veterans receiving care at the VA. Despite well-documented problems with VA administrators, many veterans prefer to receive their care at VA hospitals. And many VA facilities specialize in care like post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and prosthetics.

“We don’t have the money” is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.

“We don’t have the money” is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.

The solution is to reform the VA, and redirect those savings into veterans care. This includes cutting excess administrators (not caregivers) through Jeb’s ‘3-out, 1-in’ proposal, and improving practices so that we eliminate billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, we must fire bureaucrats who refuse to make bidding for VA contracts competitive (as required by law), improve whistleblower protections –by accelerating the conferring of whistleblower status and disciplining bosses who retaliate against whistleblowers– and remove the VA from missions unrelated to veteran services, such as construction. A whistleblower said that the VA misspent as much as $5 billion in outside care contracts that did not meet requirements for competition. Those funds were misspent in violation of federal law, and included gross overpayments in pharmaceuticals, services, and procurement.

Ample resources exist within the VA budget to improve the quality and scope of care. Annual targets for reform savings and choice expansion should be set. Targeted increases in choice would be tied to savings achieved through reform. In other government agencies, commonsense reforms have saved billions. The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.

The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.

Further, steps must be made to address the wait list for care. Congress and Veteran Service Organizations have put several proposals forth to lower the wait for appointments, and many of them are worthy of careful consideration. In the short term, VA pharmacies should be allowed to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. The current practice requires that all medication be approved in-house, often requiring a VA doctor to confirm the opinion of a veteran’s private doctor. This is a redundancy that extends wait times for veterans in need.

Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality Services

The VA Secretary said last year, “I can’t just walk into the room and fire someone.” If a VA employee is guilty of incompetence severe enough that a veteran loses his life, the Secretary should be able to do exactly that.

The problem is that the VA, like the federal government writ large, is beholden to both complex union contracts and a broken civil service system. These impediments make it nearly impossible for managers to discipline or fire employees. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, it takes an average of six months to a year to fire a government employee. And after firing, the employee can appeal that decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  Then the MSPB process can add many more months before finality of the employment action.

The Veterans Choice Access and Accountability Act of 2014 created a new way to remove career Senior Executives (SES), based upon performance or misconduct within the Department. Unfortunately, the law only applies to Senior Executive Service (SES) employees — roughly 370 of VA’s 300,000-employee workforce.

Jeb’s Plan

It will take the will of leadership to truly hold employees accountable, which thus far has not been demonstrated by President Obama’s Administration.

The firing authority provided by the Choice Act should apply to all VA employees, especially those who engage in any conduct that results in a lapse of care for a veteran, or are responsible for waste, fraud, and abuse. Further, paid administrative leave for disciplinary investigations should be limited to 14 days per year.

Quote_FiringAuthority
The VA has also treated whistleblowers shamefully. To correct this, the timeline for deciding whistleblower status should be accelerated, new whistleblower protections added, and new disciplinary procedures for managers who retaliate against whistleblowers should be established.

Further reforms to the SES at VA are needed. This should include the ability to rescind an employee’s pension if convicted of a felony related to VA, and the authority to rescind a bonus at any time.

The point is not to simply punish those who fail, but reward the overwhelming number of VA employees who have devoted their lives to serving veterans. If a VA employee fails in his or her mission, to ‘care for those who have borne the battle,’ they must step aside or be removed so that talented employees can rise up.

Modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs

The VA still operates under archaic practices and procedures, despite spending around $4Bn on information technology annually. It has struggled to adapt to the 21st century. In an era of high speed Internet, revolutionary advances in medicine, fiber optics and interconnectivity, the VA can still take months to deliver care and responses that could be transmitted in seconds.

Jeb’s Plan

One of the key problems with the wait-list manipulation scandal in 2014 was that the VA relied on an antiquated and unreliable scheduling software system. The software was old and susceptible to falsification. New software is more than capable of eliminating those vulnerabilities and improving the VA user experience.

In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle. The current online system is difficult to use, especially for older veterans.

In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle.

There are also obstacles to refilling prescriptions online, a feature available at most pharmacies nationwide. While the VA does have a system set up for online prescription refills, it is poorly designed. The VA should explore public-private partnerships to replace shoddy software.

Veterans have gone too long without a secure online credential that proves their status as veterans. The current system requires a paper copy of the DD-214, a form used to verify service and military discharge. The VA should team with the private sector to create a single, safe credential for veterans that verifies their service and eligibility for benefits.

This credential would be provided as they separate from service. Such credentialing could allow a faster admission to veterans eligible for the choice program, allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online. In person, a veteran should be able to pull out a smart phone and prove their service with a few touches of the screen.

The problems at the VA are not purely software issues. While it has failed to adapt as quickly as it should to technological advances, the VA still uses out-of-date practices that have outlived their usefulness.

An obvious example is that of hospital construction. A new hospital in Denver, Colorado was estimated at $800 million in construction costs. A new estimate is $1.7 billion dollars, nearly a billion over budget. The VA has no business being in the construction industry. It should stick to tending to the wounded. The practice is outmoded and would be better accomplished by more relevant federal agencies.

Create More Opportunities for Veterans

While veterans’ unemployment has dropped in recent years, nearly 600,000 veterans were still unemployed in 2014. Almost 550 service-members transition from the military daily, and approximately one million veterans will rejoin civilian society in the next 3-5 years.

Jeb’s Plan

Only 48 percent of working age veterans use their GI Bill benefits, and only 52 percent of those veterans complete their field of study. But veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self-employed than non-veterans, and $1.2 trillion in sales is generated from 2.4 million veteran-owned businesses – which represent nearly 9 percent of all U.S. small businesses.

A way to both reduce underuse and misuse of GI benefits is to allow the GI bill to be used to insure a small business loan. Eligible veterans could borrow against their earned GI bill benefits to start a small business, in lieu of using it for education.

Restore Troop Levels

While veterans’ benefits have rightly been protected from the Budget Control Act and Sequestration, the impact has still been felt at VA facilities. Active duty members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) hit a high point in 2010 with 1.4 million members. Under current defense cuts, it is set to drop to 1.2 million by 2019.

Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.

Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.

Jeb’s Plan

While the military cuts should be reversed for purely strategic security reasons, the fact stands that the sheer number of service members leaving service is overwhelming the VA. The Pentagon needs more soldiers and the VA is inundated with new veterans. Ending the rapid troop drawdown is a simple, pragmatic solution to both problems.

Improve Healthcare for Female Veterans

Fully 15 percent of active duty and 18 percent of National Guard and Reserves forces are women, with projections saying those percentages will grow. In contrast, the percentage of women in uniform was just 2 percent in 1950. Under modern combat policies, women are serving in hostile areas in increasing numbers and are incurring critical injuries at levels similar to their male counterparts.

However, since the VHA has been historically orientated to care for men, women have received fewer immunizations, fewer cancer screenings, and fewer mental health screenings than their male counterparts.

Jeb’s Plan

It’s time to improve healthcare services for female veterans. That starts by preparing for the further growth in the female veterans population with responsive programs in organization, staff, and training – including in obstetrics, gynecology, and specializations in ovarian and breast cancer.

The agency underwent an assessment in 2012 to measure the quality of care for the growing population of female veterans. That was a welcome step. However, more must be done, particularly when it comes to engaging the female veterans population and making them aware of the care options available to them, including in the area of mental health services as the long-term behavioral health effects of traumatic brain injury and PTSD are not yet known.

Military service members will be facing these challenges long after they have separated and will require care as veterans. The VA needs to ramp their behavioral health services and resources.

Honor Veterans’ Service

One obstacle to a successful transition from military to civilian life is the stereotype of the wounded, helpless vet overcome with issues like anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Many well-intentioned programs have unintentionally fed into the narrative of the “broken hero.” Polling suggests this has had a tangible effect on an employer’s willingness to hire veterans, despite the fact that they generally outperform non-veterans in the workplace.

Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that.

Jeb’s Plan

Jeb is committed to using the bully pulpit of a national election and his presidency to honor the service and character of America’s veterans. Their many virtues –commitment, loyalty, reliability, and integrity— will be highlighted, as well as how those merits inject value into communities and businesses. Organizations like Team Rubicon and Hire Heroes recognize that the best way to help veterans is to offer them a noble purpose and the dignity of a rewarding career. They should be acknowledged. Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that. This will be a priority of his first term in office and beyond.

Regulatory Reform

READ MORE
Regulations are choking America’s economy, imposing an invisible tax of $1.9 trillion every year – that’s $15,000 per family.

1.88 Tril
During his time in the White House, President Obama has added roughly $3,100 per second in regulatory burdens to the economy.

EverySecond
Think what America could be and the prosperity we could experience if we took off the shackles from government rules and rule makers. My goal as president would be to set new, reasonable standards for the government agencies that issue rules that choke economic activity and opportunity.

As president, I will use my executive authority to do the following:

First, we will require regulators to live within a budget – for every one dollar of regulatory cost they propose, they will need to also propose ways to save an equivalent dollar through regulatory relief. We will implement a “one in, one out” regulatory budget.  A rule like this would have avoided roughly $99 billion in regulatory costs over the Obama presidency.

Second, we will enhance and enforce presidential control over regulations. Regulations will not be issued unless regulators have identified a major market or policy failure that new regulations are likely to solve. They will need to show that state-based solutions are insufficient and that benefits outweigh costs. And we will expect regulators to strictly adhere to the plain, ordinary meaning of constitutional and statutory limitations. I will also sign the REINS Act into law, empowering Congress to approve or reject, through a simple majority vote, regulations that impose outsized burdens on the economy.

Additional Materials On This Policy:

Videos and RemarksOp EdsDownloadsLatest Content
Third, we will establish a two-year deadline for completing federal permitting process – including environmental impact reviews — for major infrastructure projects that are mired in delays stretching up to a decade or more. We will get highway, port, bridge and other critical projects going, creating jobs and growing our economy.

Loosing Time
Last we will repeal or reform the most onerous Obama rules and regulations. That starts with:

Dodd-Frank
Waters of the United States Rule
The Carbon Rule
The Coal Ash Rule
Net Neutrality
Together, we will role back the surging tide of regulations that have overtaken us the last 6 and a half years.

Energy Policy For Growth

READ MORE
Unleash the Energy Revolution

Americans continue to endure anemic economic growth of barely 2% a year. For most people, it continues to be too hard to find a good paying job, get a raise or simply make ends meet. Some call this “the new normal,” but it is unacceptable.  With the right policies and leadership, we can, in the near-term, achieve 4% growth and restore the opportunity for every American to rise. But that will only happen if we reverse damaging federal energy policies.

The Energy Revolution and Growth

Energy is not just a sector of our economy. It is also an input into every other economic sector. That means cheaper, more reliable energy benefits American families in multiple ways. More domestic energy leads to more jobs, higher wages, lower gas prices and smaller electricity bills. In short, it means more money in people’s pockets, allowing them more freedom to make more choices for themselves and their children.

Current federal energy policies impose Washington, DC’s will on how states, tribes, businesses and families produce and use energy. In spite of this, the United States has managed to benefit over the last several years from an American innovation. A combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling is transforming the United States into a global energy superpower. For instance, since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80%, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history. Even with the recent slowdown in production due to lower energy prices, America will continue to produce vastly more oil and gas than it has in decades, with corresponding economic and strategic benefits.

A Once-in-a-Generation Economic Opportunity

EnergyRevolution_Graphics-05The U.S. is still in the early stages of capitalizing on this economic opportunity. The Energy Revolution creates jobs in the oil and gas fields. Researchers at Dartmouth University found that every $1 million of oil and gas extracted from an oil or gas well generates, within 100 miles of that well, an additional $263,000 in wages and 2.8 new jobs. It also creates jobs throughout the oil and gas supply chain. For example, diesel engines that drive drilling rigs in Texas are largely manufactured in the U.S. heartland including in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan.

A Manufacturing Renaissance, a million new jobs

However, job creation extends well beyond the oil and gas industry and its suppliers. A Harvard Business School/Boston Consulting Group study asserts, “We believe that the single-largest source of competitive advantage and economic opportunity for the United States over the next decade or two is likely to be energy”. Cheaper energy can reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. The result, more Americans find work.

PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts the cheaper energy produced by the Energy Revolution will result in the creation of 930,000 new manufacturing jobs by 2030 and 1.41 million by 2040.

An Energy Plan for Americans to Rise

1. Lift Restrictions on Exports of Oil and Natural Gas

Current law bans the export of crude oil and makes it difficult to export natural gas to non-Free Trade Agreement countries such as Japan, China and the European Union.

Lifting the ban on crude oil exports and liberalizing natural gas exports would create hundreds of thousands of additional jobs and significantly lower net energy costs within two years. For instance, estimates from various studies indicate retail gasoline prices would drop by approximately 6 cents a gallon within 2 to 3 years of lifting the crude oil ban.

2. Approve the Keystone XL Pipeline

EnergyRevolution_Graphics-04President Obama and Hillary Clinton have baldly politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. After seven years and an unprecedented level of environmental review, there is now no credible reason for the President to stand in the way of this privately-funded project. Its approval would increase GDP by over $3 billion and support 42,000 jobs while the pipeline is under construction. Once built, it will be an essential piece of infrastructure more safely and cheaply moving both Canadian and U.S. resources to consumers.

3. Reduce Overregulation

Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment. Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama Administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary.

Overregulation affects energy directly and indirectly. Some new rules, such as overwriting state and tribal standards for hydraulic fracturing operations, directly discourage investment in domestic oil and gas operations. Other, broader regulations, such as Obama’s Carbon Rule, attempt to impose the President’s conception of how everyone should produce and consume energy.

The damaging effect such heavy-handed regulation has, not only on energy security but on American households, is largely hidden to the average consumer. For instance, unless it is quickly addressed by the courts, in the near-term, Obama’s Carbon Rule will increase electricity prices for everyone and threaten the system’s reliability.

Obama’s Carbon Rule will increase electricity prices for everyone and threaten the system’s reliability

Perhaps worse, such regulation saps America’s dynamism. We have, thus far, benefited from the Energy Revolution simply because Washington did not have time to quash it, but we will never know how many other innovations have been lost due to overregulation.

Addressing this regulatory mess requires a president willing to restore regulators’ accountability to the American people.  A week ago, I proposed significant reforms that will broadly improve the rulemaking process. Because affordable energy is so important to American families and our economy, rules and permitting practices that unnecessarily suppress domestic energy production and raise prices need to be immediately addressed by the next president. Some, such as Obama’s Carbon Rule, need to be stopped in their tracks.

Rules and permitting practices that unnecessarily suppress domestic energy production and raise prices need to be immediately addressed by the next President.

4. Defer to Willing States and Tribes

At least two states, Alaska and Virginia, have expressed an interest in further developing energy resources but have been thwarted or constrained by the Obama Administration. For instance, Alaskans overwhelmingly want to develop onshore and offshore energy resources in or near their state. Yet the President has severely limited the extent to which these lands can be explored and developed. Even more extreme, Hillary Clinton has indicated she would flatly prohibit drilling off the northern coast of Alaska.

This must change. Washington should generally defer to the will of states and tribes. Their citizens and leaders are best able to weigh the benefits and costs of oil and gas development.

Sustaining Growth

Once achieved, the nation must maintain higher growth with energy policies that continue to increase jobs and lower costs over the long-term. In the coming months, I will release additional proposals that will complement our status as an energy superpower by revitalizing our position as the superpower of energy innovation.

For instance, we can further accelerate the discovery of game-changing technologies by boosting funding for high-priority basic research and increasing the effectiveness of our national labs. The private sector often underfunds energy research that could greatly benefit society. Government can correct that. My record and experience in Florida shows how world-class research contributes to jobs and technological advances that can improve everyone’s quality of life.

IMG_3256
laughing with factory people

In addition, we must create a level playing field for all energy sources including, but not limited to, nuclear, renewables, coal, natural gas, oil and alternative fuels. We unnecessarily drive up energy costs on Americans when we play favorites and suppress the dynamism of free markets.

Further, producers and consumers must have better access to new technologies such as “intelligent” electricity management devices, unconventional transportation fuels, advanced nuclear power designs and cutting-edge energy conservation methods. We must remove burdensome government regulations, subsidies and other barriers that get in the way of adopting and exploiting such innovations.

Energy, Unleashed, Can Help All Americans Rise

Taken together, these policies will fully unleash the Energy Revolution, creating more jobs, higher wages, cheaper gas and cheaper electricity, while better protecting our interests abroad and our environment. This plan will help us quickly achieve, and sustain, 4% economic growth.

With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation – and with presidential leadership, we can make it happen.

But to achieve these policies, we have to change the way Washington works. And we have to change who we send there to lead. With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation – and with presidential leadership, we can make it happen in the near-term. If we do all of this, and if we do it right, we will make the United States of America an economic superpower like no other.

The Conservative Plan for 21st Century Health

ObamaCare is a government takeover of more than one-sixth of the American economy, and it epitomizes why Americans are so fed up with Washington. To win on repeal, conservatives must unite  around a vision of health care for the future – one that enables transformational innovation. Governor Bush’s plan would repeal ObamaCare and accomplish three things:

1. Promote innovation
2. Lower costs
3. Return power to states

Here is how Governor Bush would repeal and replace ObamaCare:

1. Promote innovation in health care

Health care costs grow faster than any other sector of the economy and innovation lags. Why? Washington over-regulation in health care creates high barriers to entry, adds excessive costs, fosters excessive complexity and impedes innovation. Governor Bush will:

Modernize the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory morass and increase funding and accountability at the National Institutes of Health
Promote private sector leadership of health information technology adoption and enable better access to patient de-identified Medicare and Medicaid claims data
Establish a comprehensive review of regulatory barriers to health innovation
Washington over-regulation in health care creates high barriers to entry, adds excessive costs, fosters excessive complexity and impedes innovation.

2. Lower costs and enable portable, secure coverage for all Americans

Until health care is oriented around consumers, providers and innovation, Americans will not get better value and results out of the health care system. In addition, coverage options must reflect a modern, 21st century workforce where workers frequently switch jobs or start new businesses and need the security of portable coverage.

Until health care is oriented around consumers, providers and innovation, Americans will not get better value and results out of the health care system.

It is critical to have a well-functioning individual market side-by-side with a strong employer-sponsored coverage market. The employer health insurance market represents a strong and innovative coverage platform for 154 million Americans. To improve coverage, Governor Bush will:

Provide a tax credit for the purchase of affordable, portable health plans that protect Americans from high-cost medical events
Increase contribution limits and uses for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to help with out-of-pocket costs
Facilitate transparency on costs and outcomes
Cap the employer tax exclusion to lower insurance premiums
Allow employers to use financial incentives to encourage wellness programs
Enable small businesses to make tax-free contributions to their workers’ individual, portable health plans

3. Take health care control out of Washington and return it to states

States should have responsibility, freedom and accountability to make their individual insurance markets more competitive, enhance access to care and design solutions for vulnerable Americans. Instead of Washington standardization, this approach emphasizes transparent outcome standards. States will have streamlined, capped federal funding and be responsible for meeting transparent metrics to:

Make their insurance markets more competitive. This will include enabling access to affordable, catastrophic plans in their states; a continuous coverage guarantee for individuals with pre-existing conditions; access to affordable care and improved health outcomes in their state; lower health care cost growth, including medical liability reform; and a transition plan for the 17 million individuals entangled in ObamaCare.
Strengthen the health care safety net. To achieve this, states may use a number of strategies: individualized, community-based benefit designs; coordinated care for individuals with behavioral health conditions and the disabled; tailored care delivery to reflect the diversity of state populations; personalized care solutions for high-risk individuals with proven data analytics; work requirements for able-bodied individuals; premium assistance for individual and employer-provided coverage; and consolidated funding from various programs to better coordinate care.

Cybersecurity

The Internet has transformed everyday life for people, revolutionizing communications and how Americans interact with each other and the world.  The Internet’s impact on economic growth has likewise been profound.  U.S. manufacturers reported e-commerce shipments were $3.3 trillion in 2013.  According to one report, from 2004 to 2009, the Internet accounted for 15% of GDP growth.

Yet, for all of the Internet’s transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factor—cybersecurity.  If people have no confidence their information will remain safe online, they will—quite simply—be less willing to use the Internet, thereby jeopardizing future growth possibilities.

…for all of the Internet’s transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factor—cybersecurity.

Unfortunately, a series of high-profile cybersecurity failures and the Obama administration’s feeble response to the growing threat have demonstrated real vulnerabilities in government and private systems, eroding public confidence in both the government and even the Internet itself.  In June, I published some thoughts on cybersecurity, and at many town halls across the country I hear concerns from Americans about this threat.

This is an issue that gravely needs presidential leadership.  Ultimately, we need Internet security, and a strong tech industry that can be leveraged to the public’s benefit, in order to achieve high, sustained economic growth that will benefit everyone.  Let’s not mince words: in order to achieve 4% growth and the 19 million jobs that come with it, we need a vibrant and secure Internet.  Here is my plan to achieve that, starting with tackling the cybersecurity challenge.

1. Place a Command Focus on Cybersecurity.

We need to recognize the reality that today we are under cyberattack and we are not keeping up with the threat.  We also need to identify clearly the mission for government and the private sector: to work together to ensure the security of the Internet.  The rapid expansion of information technology in the past several decades, coupled with both the open architecture of the Internet and poor cybersecurity practices, have contributed to a dramatic rise in cyberthreats to the nation.  Last year, 60% of all targeted attacks struck small and medium-sized organizations, which often have fewer resources to invest in cybersecurity.  In 2014, five out of every six large companies were targeted with spear-phishing attacks, a 40% increase over the previous year.  Attacks against small and medium-sized businesses increased 26% and 30%, respectively.  And these are just the attacks we know about.  Many penetrations go unnoticed or unreported by companies that are victims of these attacks.

Effective cybersecurity starts with all of us — individuals, businesses, and the government—recognizing the importance of Internet security and our responsibility to help ensure its robust defense.  Effective cybersecurity depends in large part on the protective measures one takes before a cyberattack.  If we do not make cybersecurity a priority, we will continue to see major breaches and damaging attacks.  Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.

Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.

2. Restore Accountability within the Federal Government.

The government should lead by example.  We need presidential leadership to get government to take the cybersecurity threat more seriously, fix the vulnerabilities of government systems, and hold government leaders accountable for the security of information entrusted to their care.  It is easy to give a speech about cybersecurity.  What we need is unwavering leadership and determined implementation, including a concerted effort to work with Congress.

The intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—the human resources department of the U.S. Government—illustrates the cultural failure of the Obama administration to take these threats seriously.  The OPM systems contain millions of personnel records—many of which included an intrusive and sensitive personnel questionnaire.  OPM officials knew this data was valuable, sensitive, and vulnerable, but failed to take basic steps to protect it.

We need to change the culture of government, which is impossible absent presidential leadership.  Leadership means not hiring political hacks or cronies for critical positions that involve cybersecurity.  It also means holding executive branch officials accountable for their failure to prioritize cybersecurity and protect the networks under their care.  The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.

The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.

The President also cannot allow cabinet secretaries and senior officials to violate rules and procedures meant to protect classified and national security-related government communications.  It should not be too much to ask government officials to abide by the laws and rules in place to safeguard our national security.  Secretary Hillary Clinton’s growing email scandal highlights reckless behavior by officials entrusted with some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets.

3. Increase U.S. Intelligence and Law Enforcement Cybersecurity Capabilities and Strengthen International Cooperation.

We need to preserve and enhance the capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement to identify, deter, and respond to cyberattacks as part of a national strategy to protect the country.  This starts by undoing the damage that sequestration has done to the Defense Department and Intelligence Community and restoring funding to them.  The National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the frontlines of defending the United States against cyberthreats.  We must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation also needs more resources to fight back against the onslaught of cybercrime.

In addition, we must reform a convoluted acquisition process that imposes years of delays and inefficiencies in procuring new cybersecurity systems.  The Defense committees of Congress are already working on acquisition reform—the President should work with these committees and others to ensure that a byzantine acquisition process is streamlined for cybersecurity defense technologies.  The government could build upon some of the lessons learned by Secretary Bob Gates’ efforts to reform parts of the inefficient and costly defense acquisition process.

The President should also prioritize cybersecurity in discussions and agreements with our allies and partners around the world.  No one country can solve the cybersecurity problem, which is a global challenge.  The need to protect sensitive systems from bad actors is a modern-day equivalent of securing the world’s oceans for freedom of navigation, and just as nations came together to protect the seas, they should do so to secure the Internet.  At the same time, the United States must retain a strong leadership position in Internet governance.  For example, we should maintain oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages the Internet’s domain name system.

We must also hold to account those who are stealing our nation’s intellectual capital.  Efforts to expose, prosecute, and in some cases retaliate against these actors will raise the cost of conducting such attacks and increase deterrence of future attacks.  Such deterrence will be stronger if we work with partners to establish international rules of the road and get them to establish the legal framework necessary to prosecute cybercriminals.

4. Create Public-Private Partnerships to Improve Cybersecurity in the Public and Private Sectors.

The U.S. Government and businesses should work together as partners to improve cybersecurity in public and private sectors in a way that also respects citizens’ privacy.  Just as the government needs to pay more attention to cybersecurity, so too must the private sector.  The government must do its part in getting its own house in order and then enable, empower, and expect the private sector to do the same.  Some industries take this threat more seriously than others, and there are lessons to be learned from their experiences.

The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors.  And to be clear, this will not be achieved with finger pointing and talking down to industries that have struggled with security while looking the other way as our classified information is handed over to state-sponsored cyberterrorists.

The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors.

At a minimum, the government should redouble efforts to: (1) reduce legal and technical barriers to cybersecurity information sharing between the federal government and private sector, and (2) promote best practices for the private sector, including voluntary cybersecurity standards (e.g., through the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s ongoing work).

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to facilitate information sharing by, among other measures, providing liability protection to private-sector companies that share cyberthreat information with each other or with the government.  Unfortunately, the bill languishes in the Senate due to opposition from Senate Democrats.  The President should lean on these Democrats to allow this bill to come to the Senate floor for a vote.

5. Remove Barriers to Innovation in the Tech Industry.

As part of this national effort to improve cybersecurity, the government must not be an obstacle to innovation in the tech industry.  The government’s power to incentivize and empower must take precedence over its predilection to regulate and constrain.  Because cyberthreats are always evolving, effective cybersecurity requires continuous innovation, which a flourishing tech industry provides.

We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity.

We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity.  For example, regulatory barriers continue to make it extremely complicated, costly, and time-consuming for small companies to raise capital through the securities markets.  The Securities and Exchange Commission should reassess existing regulations to further minimize the number and complexity of documents that must be filed before everyday Americans are able to invest in emerging companies.  It should also work to ensure rules are in place to enable the creation of liquid markets for securities offered by startups.  We need to transform immigration into an economically-driven system that retains and brings in highly-skilled immigrants.  Such a system would help create startups and increase innovation.  We must lower business taxes to encourage investment and hiring in the United States.

The Internet and innovation from the tech industry have enormous potential to help address public policy challenges.  For example, digital connections between power plants, transformers, substations, and transmission lines allow for better management of the electric grid.  With such networks, utilities are better able to anticipate, avoid, or respond to power outages.  Using technology we can create a secure online credential for veterans that verifies their military service.  Such a credential could allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online.  However, without a secure Internet, these types of initiatives may never reach their full potential.  Our country, starting with the President and federal government, must recognize the cybersecurity challenge and dedicate itself to conquering it.

The Internet is one of the greatest innovations in history and has led to unrivaled opportunity and a great leveling of the playing field for all.  I will be a President who works to actually bring people together from both sides of the aisle, as well as the public and private domains, to better address the very real threats confronting this critical global resource.

Under President Obama and Congress, the military will be cut by over a trillion dollars. Tens of thousands of troops have been forced out of uniform and into a broken economy. Those who remain are using old equipment, experiencing lapses in training and have been asked to do more missions with fewer people and resources.

Our adversaries around the world have taken notice. Russia is on the march, China has quadrupled its military spending, Iran is backing terror groups throughout the Middle East, North Korea continues to make threats in the Pacific and ISIS has expanded its war beyond Syria, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan to Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt and even France.

Governor Bush has a four-point strategy to rebuild our military, restore American leadership, defend our nation and bring order back to the international system.

Governor Bush has a four-point strategy to rebuild our military, restore American leadership, defend our nation and bring order back to the international system. He recognizes that it is our Constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. And he knows that the American people just want to be safe to live their lives in peace.

1. Restore International Order & Promote International Stability

After the Second World War, the United States built a series of alliances in order to preserve peace and protect prosperity. That system of alliances is under growing stress. Governor Bush would reinvigorate America’s special role as world leader. He would increase our commitment to NATO to counter an insatiable Russia, including sending an Army Special Forces Group back to European Command. He would increase our presence, restore alliances and build new partnerships in Asia. He would stand up to Iranian aggression in the Middle East, defeat ISIS and restore stability to Iraq and Syria. Finally, Governor Bush would increase partner-building exercises with foreign militaries, to lessen the load on U.S. forces.

2. Rebuild the Military to Defend American Interests & Values

Governor Bush opposes the $1 trillion in defense cuts passed by President Obama and Congress. He has committed to rebuilding the military and restoring faith with our troops. Governor Bush would increase the size of the Army by 40,000 soldiers and the size of the Marine Corps by 4,000 Marines. He would increase the size of the Navy and increase Virginia-class submarine production. He would replace aircraft that is older than our pilots. Governor Bush believes that the best way to secure the peace is to be strong and ready for any national emergency.

3. Reform the Pentagon

While the military needs to be rebuilt, Governor Bush does not believe in giving the Pentagon a blank check. He will institute strong reforms there, fixes that treat the taxpayer dollar with more respect and that get our troops equipment they need in a timely manner. He will reduce DC bureaucrats to free up resources for more uniformed military. Governor Bush believes it is our sacred obligation to make certain our men and women in uniform have the best training, equipment and leadership in the world.

4. Defend the Homeland

The first and most sacred obligation of the U.S. Government is to provide for the common defense, an enumerated responsibility in the Constitution. Protecting our shores is the number one of priority of government. Governor Bush believes that this starts with securing our border. He also has laid out plans to improve our cyber security and protect critical infrastructure that links avenues of commerce, transportation and energy. With the threat of terrorism at an all-time high, Governor Bush has committed himself to keeping Americans safe.
