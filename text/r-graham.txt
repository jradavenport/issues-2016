Secure Our Nation
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
We need a president who is prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One. Our nation faces grave threats at home and in every region of the globe. Radical Islam is on the rise, and authoritarian leaders in Russia and China perpetrate their aggressions with impunity. Our allies distrust us and our enemies have no reason to respect or fear us. We need a president who understands the complex threats we face, has a clear and coherent strategy for addressing them, and will restore strong American leadership as a stabilizing force that reduces the chaos and conflict that currently engulf so much of the world. As president, Lindsey Graham would ensure we have the capability, the capacity, and the will to preserve our security and our values at home and abroad.

Restore American Leadership
We must end the practice of capitulating to our adversaries, alienating our allies, and abandoning those who are confronting the naked aggressions of dictatorial regimes. The threats and chaos plaguing every corner of the globe demand comprehensive strategies, and the military might to back them up. Leading from behind or retreating into isolationism only allows global threats to grow and raises the costs in the long term of securing our nation. We need a return to presidential leadership on the world stage that ensures the protection of Americans.

Fully Fund and Support Our Military
Our ballooning national debt poses a serious threat to our national security, but failed attempts to address it by blindly and recklessly slashing military funding are equally dangerous. We must reverse President Obama’s disastrous military cuts that put our security and our troops at risk, and replace them with responsible, targeted cuts and meaningful reforms that reduce federal spending the smart way. Our military is the world's most elite fighting force, and we must maintain our global superiority while keeping faith with the men and women who serve in uniform.

Defeat Forces of Radical Islam
No other strain of terrorism today poses a greater threat to our homeland, our troops, or our interests around the globe. The forces of Radical Islam, such as ISIS, are bent on the destruction of our way of life. Under President Obama, they have been allowed to become large, rich, and entrenched. We need to make them small, poor, and on the run. This will require an expanded presence of 10,000 troops in the region as part of a well-defined strategy with partner nations. Only by taking the fight to the enemy will we ensure that this war is never fought in our homeland.

Prevent a Nuclear and Belligerent Iran
We must ensure – at all costs – that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon or has the ability to share nuclear weapon technology with violent extremists committed to killing Americans. Iran is the greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It has sworn to destroy the State of Israel, and it has spread violence and chaos throughout the entire region. If Iran were to obtain a nuclear weapon, a nuclear arms race would ensue in the Middle East that would pose a direct threat to the security of America and our allies.

Provide Unwavering Support for Israel
Israel is one of our staunchest allies and closest friends. It is also the only nation in the Middle East that shares our democratic values. We need a president who will promote, protect, and support our critical relationship. Our president must not view support for Israel as a burden, but as the bedrock of peace, stability, and security in the Middle East.

Secure Our Future
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
National security and economic security are inextricably linked. A strong, prosperous, growing economy enables our nation to project leadership worldwide and effectively address the range of security threats we face. By the same token, a strong national defense preserves our liberties and ensures that every American has the opportunity to achieve economic success and pursue a higher quality of life. These opportunities must extend to all Americans, not just to a privileged few. As president, Lindsey Graham would pursue the policies and provide the leadership to ensure a growing economy and middle class.

Restore Fiscal Discipline
Washington spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much. We need to enact smart cuts and implement meaningful, systemic reforms of the entitlement programs that constitute the vast majority of our looming fiscal crisis. We need to simplify our tax code and expand our tax base. Lindsey Graham will end the practice of pushing the hard choices off to future generations.

Reform Entitlements
Within just a few short years, our entitlement programs face bankruptcy and trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that will cause our already ballooning debt to skyrocket and cripple our economy. Fixing Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is the linchpin to balancing future budgets and ensuring solvency for future generations. To do so, they must be reformed and modernized so that our seniors are protected, our critically important safety net is preserved, and our long-term fiscal outlook is secured.

Achieve Energy Independence
America should run on American energy. We cannot afford to exclude any source of energy here at home, from shale to nuclear to clean coal to renewables. We must build the Keystone pipeline and increase oil and gas exploration in the U.S., and do so in a way that protects the air we breathe and the water we drink. This is a vitally important matter of economic security and job creation, but it also has significant implications for national security. Every new domestic energy source we utilize reduces our dependence on oil from rogue regimes.

Ease Tax and Regulatory Burdens
Families and businesses should no longer suffer the consequences of a complex, burdensome tax and regulatory regime that stifles growth and innovation, and prevents Americans from reaping the full benefits of their hard work. Making our tax code simpler and fairer will unleash the economic power of American ingenuity and restore opportunity for working families at every rung of the economic ladder.

Secure the Border and Fix Illegal Immigration
The flow of illegal immigration across our borders is a threat to both our economic and national security. We need a comprehensive plan to address this problem and it starts with securing our border. On the economic front, American workers, who are forced to pay taxes, are being cheated by illegal immigrants paid under the table. We should require illegal immigrants to register with the government to ensure they are paying taxes, learning English, undergoing background checks, and paying restitution for entering our nation illegally. Then, after living under our laws and our rules, we should require they wait for citizenship behind legal immigrants already in line. Finally, after going through this lengthy process -- including paying fines, paying taxes, learning English, and passing an American civics and assimilation exam -- which should take a decade or longer, an illegal immigrant could become a citizen, rather than remaining in the shadows and outside the arm of the law. Most important, we need presidential leadership on this issue to build consensus and craft solutions through constitutional means, not executive fiat.

Repeal and Replace Obamacare
Obama's radical policy to remake our healthcare system has left countless Americans shut out of their preferred plans with their preferred doctors, paying higher premiums and deductibles, and working fewer hours. We need to repeal and replace this deeply flawed program with real reforms that will improve access to quality, affordable care for all Americans.

Making Washington Work
The president represents our entire country, not just a single party. We need a leader who is firmly grounded in conservative principles. But our president must also recognize we have two parties, as well as a large number of those who belong to neither. Getting the important work done requires reaching out to Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. True leadership is the ability to bring Americans of all stripes together to forge a path forward that makes our nation stronger, more secure, and more prosperous.

Secure Our Values
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
America was built upon the fundamental notions that life and liberty are sacred and inalienable rights. Our limited, constitutional government was designed to protect these rights. We need a president who will uphold the sanctity of life, defend our right to keep and bear arms, and preserve the liberties and traditional values upon which this country was founded. As president, Lindsey Graham will vigorously defend these core values and ensure that America remains a shining city on a hill.

Protect the Sanctity of Life
There is no part of society more vulnerable and in need of our protection than the unborn. The inalienable right to life of every innocent human being is an essential element of a civil society. From authoring the Unborn Victims of Violence Act to co-sponsoring the Partial Birth Abortion ban, Lindsey Graham has a long history of leadership on pro-life legislation. The Graham 20-Week Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is the most important federal pro-life effort today. This essential legislation, authored and sponsored by Lindsey Graham, bans abortions at 20 weeks, when a fetus is capable of feeling pain. It represents a critical step toward reaffirming the sanctity of life and preserving the basic constitutional rights of the most vulnerable. We need a president who always has, and always will, fight for the rights of the unborn.

Preserve Traditional Marriage and Protect Religious Freedom
Strong families are the core of a strong America. Traditional marriage as a union between a man and a woman has been the bedrock of human civilization for thousands of years. It is an institution that benefits society in a way that no other relationship can. We must tirelessly support families, traditional values, and religious freedom against efforts to diminish and undermine them. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that state bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional, making the need to protect the right of every American to freely exercise sincerely held religious beliefs all the more urgent. We need a president who will staunchly defend these liberties and devote the necessary federal resources to ensure that no one's First Amendment right to freedom of religion is infringed.

Protect Religious Freedom Globally
People of faith are under attack around the globe. Christians, Jews, and Muslims are being subjected to barbaric acts by radical Islamic terrorists in the Middle East and North Africa, while others face persecution in China, Pakistan, Sudan, and beyond. America must lead the charge in defending religious freedom and protecting people of faith from violent persecution throughout the world.

Defend Second Amendment Rights
As a lifelong gun owner, Lindsey Graham understands the importance of protecting the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is one of our sacred constitutional freedoms. We need a president who will vigilantly defend the rights of law-abiding citizens against the constant attacks of those who want to infringe on the Second Amendment and flagrantly disregard our constitutional freedoms.

Uphold Conservative Values in Education
Education is best handled by parents, teachers, and local communities, not Washington bureaucrats. The U.S. Department of Education has grown too large, and its bureaucratic reach goes far beyond its mission. Any coercive efforts by Washington to impose Common Core standards on state and local school districts must be resisted. Parental rights in education are of the utmost importance. Those who choose to seek a better school or to homeschool their children must be allowed to make choices that are best for their families.
