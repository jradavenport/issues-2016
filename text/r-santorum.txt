Economic Freedom Agenda
Creating more opportunity for everyone to rise in society and make life better and safer for all American workers—especially blue collar workers—and their families.

Read Rick Santorum's Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal

Read the full Santorum Economic Freedom Agenda

American families are struggling. The last years of the Bush presidency brought tremendous financial hardships. So have the Obama-Biden years. Taxes are soaring. Regulations are mounting. Spending and debt are out of control. Poverty is rising. And chronic economic weakness at home is inviting our enemies to test us abroad.

Hardworking Americans don’t see the system working for them, and many are losing hope. They increasingly fear that the American Dream is dying, that their children won’t have more freedom or opportunities than they did, that America’s best days are behind us, not ahead of us.

America deserves better. Our nation is on the wrong track.

This is why I am running for President: to fight every day to advance an Economic Freedom Agenda that will create more opportunity for everyone to rise in society and make life better and safer for all American workers – especially blue collar workers – and their families.

The 20/20 Flat Tax Plan
The chief causes of low growth and the woeful lack of sufficient job creation are the hideously complex federal income tax code, sky-high corporate tax rates, and the scandal-ridden Internal Revenue Service. Massive job-killing regulations, a completely dysfunctional immigration system, runaway spending and debt, and a host of other foolish Big Government policies further compound the problem.

But the disastrous federal tax code and the IRS that runs it have come to symbolize everything that is wrong with Washington.

It's time to drain the swamp.

My “20/20 Flat Tax Plan” is not the only element of my Economic Freedom Agenda. But it is the centerpiece. These are they key points:

Scrap the Tax Code and Unleash Economic Growth
Abolish the anti-worker, anti-family, anti-growth, anti-freedom federal income tax code once and for all and replace it with a simple, honest, fair rate system - 20% flat tax on individual income / 20% flat tax on business income.
Dramatically downsize, restructure, and reform the IRS.
Fight for American Workers
Aim to make the US, once again, the world's leading manufacturer by providing companies with a jumpstart to compensate for the current uncompetitive system in the form of a 100% income exemption to be phased out over two years and tax deductions for capital investments.
Negotiate Free Trade Agreements with the goal of expanding access to foreign markets for American products and services.
Audit the Federal Reserve and appoint a Fed Chairman committed to maintaining sound money and a strong dollar.
Increase the minimum wage by $0.50 per year for three years to bring it back in line with historical standards.
Cut Spending and Balance/Reform the Federal Budget
Fully repeal Obamacare and all of the taxes that came with it.
Call on Congress and the States to pass a Balanced-Budget Amendment to the Constitution, limiting federal spending to 18% of the GDP.
Submit to Congress a plan that balances the federal budget within five years.
Unleash America's Energy
Approve the Keystone Pipeline for jobs and energy security.
Open up market access to all forms of domestic fuel production.
Give states the freedom to choose where they want to explore for oil and natural gas and to set their own regulations for hydrofracking.
Stop Job-killing Regulation
Vigorously protect the safety and security of American workers and their families while protecting and promoting commonsense conservationist policies to safeguard America's vital natural resources.
Veto or repeal nonsensical laws, regulations, and excessive orders that claim to protect Americans but actually destroy jobs.
Reform Entitlements
Introduce work requirements for means-tested entitlement programs, including the federal food stamps program.
Cut means-tested entitlement programs by 10% across the board, freeze them for four years, and block grant them to States.
Reform and strengthen Medicare and Social Security so they are fiscally sustainable for seniors and future generations.
Stop the Surge of Both Illegal and Legal Immigration
Seal the Mexican border with an American-made wall.
Rescind the Obama-Biden measure that expand and encourage illegal immigration.
Reduce legal immigration by 25% to ensure that Americans get the first shot at new jobs and higher wages.
Veto any legislation aimed at creating amnesty.
Show your support for the Economic Freedom Agenda and the 20/20 Flat Tax by signing the petition and sharing the plan!

There is no candidate for president with stronger foreign policy credentials than Rick Santorum.

There is no candidate for president with stronger foreign policy credentials than Rick Santorum.

He is a faithful advocate for Israel, and has been a staunch voice against Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.

During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Rick was a leader on U.S.-Israeli affairs, advancing American interests in the Middle East, and standing against the forces of Radical Islam and tyranny.

He authored both the "Syria Accountability Act" and the "Iran Freedom and Support Act." He also served eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee where he led the fight before the attacks of September 11, 2001 to transform our military from a Cold War force to meet today's threats.

In addition, Santorum led the Program to Protect America’s Freedom at the Ethics and Public Policy Center from 2007 until 2011. The program focused on raising awareness about the threats to America from anti-western groups.

 Immigration Reform That Protects American Workers
 We must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.

 Over the past twenty years, nearly 35 million legal and illegal immigrants have come to our shores. This is the largest mass immigration America has seen in our history – even surpassing the Great Wave from the turn of the 20th Century. These immigrants are largely unskilled and low-skilled labor and they are competing for the same jobs as the 74% of Americans who do not have a college degree.

 Every net new job created since 2000 for people between 18 and 65 is held by someone who wasn’t born in this country. This needs to change.

 The American family is the first economy. Just like a business, each family needs revenue, pays expenses, and at the end of the month the books must balance.

 As families struggle in this ever competitive labor market, we must make sure our policies do not throw up further roadblocks and dead ends to their ability to succeed. We must rebuild this first economy, and one step is to ensure we have a responsible immigration policy that puts the American worker and their families first.

 We must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.

 Key Actions:
 Enforce the law by implementing a biometric tracking system for every immigrant who enters America so we can track who is here and who has overstayed their visa. Anyone apprehended who has overstayed their visa should be subject to fines and then subsequently removed.

 End the practice of sanctuary cities by withholding federal funds from any city that refuses to cooperate with federal authorities.

 Put an end to president Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesty which is largely responsible for the latest border surge.

 Push for congressional action to require all businesses use e-verify for all employees to assure those who play by the rules are rewarded and employers who hire illegal immigrants are held accountable.

 Join every other developed country in the world save one, and put an end to automatic citizenship for children born here to illegal immigrants.

  Valuing the dignity of every human life
  Rick is committed to fighting to ensure that our country always errs on the sides of life.

  Rick and Karen Santorum have a special place in their hearts for children with special needs. Their youngest daughter Bella was born with a serious genetic disorder Trisomy 18. Bella won’t walk and talk like the Santorums’ other children, but her ability to love others is her greatest gift. Since Bella’s birth, Rick and Karen’s commitment to protecting every life – born and unborn – has only been reaffirmed and strengthened. They know that every life matters no matter what physical or mental challenges a person may have. They are committed to fighting to ensure that our country always errs on the sides of life.

  While in the U.S. Senate, Rick authored The Combating Autism Act of 2005 which is now law and provides $860 million over five years to combat autism through research, screening, intervention, and education. He also fought for the passage of the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA).

  Rick Santorum was also an effective voice in opposition to the Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) that could threaten U.S. sovereignty and parental rights. This treaty could have put our country under international law when it comes to parenting our special needs children.

   As a husband and father, Rick Santorum knows the importance of protecting and providing for your family.

   As a husband and father, Rick Santorum knows the importance of protecting and providing for your family. He believes that at the core of the American experience is the family, and that without strong families, we cannot have a strong and vibrant nation.

   During his time in elected office, Rick Santorum fought for the preservation of the traditional American family and for the protection of the most vulnerable in our society. Rick believes marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and he has fought against efforts to redefine marriage.

   Rick was the author of legislation outlawing the heinous act known as partial-birth abortion and he championed the fight to pass the “Born Alive Infant Protection Act” and the “Unborn Victims of Violence Act.”

   He also authored legislation to advance adult stem cell research, so that ethical research could take place to fight debilitating diseases without the moral implications associated with embryonic stem cell research that destroys human life.

   In 2005, Rick sponsored the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, which would restore provisions in the Civil Rights Act that require employers to accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees.

Common Sense Instead of Common Core
Rick Santorum believes we must rally together to stop any more top-down, nationalized education standards.

Rick Santorum believes we need Common Sense not Common Core. He is opposed to Common Core and any other top-down nationalized education standards - and he has opposed Common Core from the start!

From its beginning, the Common Core State Standards initiative has flown under the radar. Its funding, its implementation, and the substance of the standards it proposes have received little public attention, but all of them are wrong for families, wrong for students, and wrong for our teachers.

Rick is most concerned by how fast these standards were adopted and how little transparency there was in the process. Not one state legislature voted on the Common Core standards. In the forty-five states where they have been adopted, it was by an act of the governor, the state secretary of education, or the state board of education. The people most affected by this enormous policy change—parents and teachers—never had a chance to weigh in.

Rick Santorum believes we must rally together to stop any more top-down, nationalized education standards.

While some states are beginning to retreat on implementation of these standards, many are not, and many more Americans don’t even know what the Common Core standards are since there was so little public debate in their adoption.

Rick Santorum knows that our country’s public education system isn’t working, and we all want to improve opportunities for our children, but more government intervention is not the answer. Instead, parents, teachers, school districts, and local communities should be making the important decisions about education.

 Fighting for the American worker
 Hard-working American families are struggling because no one is fighting for them, and Rick Santorum plans to change that.

 Rick Santorum believes that we need a pro-growth economic agenda, but we must also have a pro-worker economic agenda. Right now, hard-working American families are struggling because no one is fighting for them, and Rick Santorum plans to change that.

 The Santorum economic agenda starts by creating a fairer and flatter tax code that will treat everyone equally under tax law. This means that the IRS role in our lives will be nearly eliminated.

 Just as importantly, the Santorum economic plan will help American businesses - particularly American manufacturers - grow and thrive. Rick grew up in the steel valley of Pittsburgh and knows first-hand the positive impact manufacturing and processing jobs can have on our economy and in our families. These jobs didn't just build strong families and strong communities, they literally built America. Rick believes it’s time to revitalize manufacturing, processing, construction, and energy sectors of our economy again so America can once again thrive.

  End the Immoral Spending in Washington
  Rick Santorum has been fighting for fiscal sanity in Washington for more than a generation.

  Rick Santorum has been fighting for fiscal sanity in Washington for more than a generation. He has long supported a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and a Line Item Veto. He bravely proposed reforming entitlements, cutting spending and even developed a "spendometer" that added up the cost of Democrat amendments to spending bills.

  In the early 1990s, Rick was a member of the "Gang of Seven" that exposed the Congressional Banking and Congressional Post Office scandals. Rick was also an author and floor manager of the landmark Welfare Reform Act of 1996 that has empowered millions of Americans to leave the welfare rolls and enter the workforce.

  Senator Santorum is also a strong supporter “No Budget, No Pay” legislation that would require members of Congress to forgo pay for every day after the beginning of the government’s fiscal year that they don’t adopt a budget and pass all of its spending bills.
