Reform & Growth

READ MORE
Under President Obama, Americans have now endured six years of tax increases, endless regulation, vast new federal programs and $8 trillion in added debt. The president told us this “stimulus” would jump-start the economy. Instead, we got an anemic economy growing at barely 2% a year. Some call this “the new normal”—but it isn’t something we can accept if we are going to restore the opportunity for every American to rise and achieve earned success.

Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can’t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.

Restoring the right to rise in America requires accelerating growth, and that can’t be done without a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax code.

Today, the tax code is a labyrinth littered with thousands of special-interest giveaways, subsidies and other breaks written to favor Washington insiders. At 80,000 pages, it’s a tax code only an army of tax accountants and lobbyists could love—because they’ve written it.

The code is rigged with multiple carve-outs for favored industries. It penalizes people for moving up the economic ladder. It gives tax deductions for borrowing costs, thereby encouraging companies to take on too much debt and raising concerns about financial fragility, rather than having them focus on real investment and hiring.

Low growth, crony capitalism and easy debt—that’s President Obama’s economic agenda in a nutshell, and the tax code has helped make it possible. It’s past time for a change.

In early September I unveiled the plan that, as president, I will submit to Congress and sign into law as the Reform and Growth Act of 2017. My plan centers on accomplishing three major goals:

First, I want to lower taxes and make the tax code simple, fair and clear. It should be easy to understand and make it easy for people to fill out their own tax forms.

We will cut individual rates from seven brackets to three: 28%, 25% and 10%. At 28%, the highest tax bracket would return to where it was when President Ronald Reagan signed into law his monumental and successful 1986 tax reform.

With this reform in place, roughly 15 million Americans will no longer bear any income-tax liability. The plan nearly doubles the standard deduction now taken by roughly two-thirds of all filers. It eliminates the marriage penalty, expands the Earned Income Tax Credit, ends the death tax, retires the Alternative Minimum Tax and ends the employee’s share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers older than 67.

Second, I want to eliminate the convoluted, lobbyist-created loopholes in the code. For years, wealthy individuals have deducted a much greater share of their income than everyone else. We will retain the deductibility of charitable contributions but cap the deductions used by the wealthy and Washington special interests, enabling tax-rate cuts across the board for everyone. And while we’re doing that, we will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won’t be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains.

Third, I believe that the tax code should no longer be an impediment to the nation’s competitiveness with China, Europe and the rest of the world. Liberals will tell you that we need walls and tariffs to protect U.S. businesses from international competitors. The liberals are wrong; we need tax reform. To stop American companies from moving out of the country, I will cut the corporate tax rate from 35%—the highest in the industrial world—to 20%, which is five percentage points below China’s.

Graphs-Quotes-14
We will end the practice of world-wide taxation on U.S. businesses, which fosters the insidious tactic called corporate “inversions.” This is when small overseas companies buy big U.S. companies so that both can enjoy the lowest tax rate possible, costing American jobs and revenue. And we will assess a one-time tax of 8.75%, payable over 10 years, on the more than $2 trillion in corporate profits sitting overseas.

We will also allow businesses to fully and immediately deduct new capital investments—a critical step to increase worker productivity and wages. To pay for this, we will eliminate most corporate tax deductions—which is where favor-seeking and lobbying are most common—and remove the deduction for borrowing costs. That deduction encourages business models dependent on heavy debt.

When we accomplish these big reforms, the result will be a much simpler, leaner and fairer tax code.

I know that enacting these policies works because I’ve done it before. As governor of Florida, I cut taxes every single year—returning a total of $19 billion to Floridians. The state’s economy took off, growing at an average rate of 4.4%. Households saw bigger paychecks as median incomes rose by an average of $1,300. Florida’s pro-growth climate created 1.3 million new jobs. And we did it all while balancing the budget eight years in a row and increasing the state’s rainy-day fund by $8 billion.

Graphs-Quotes-12
By focusing on tax reform like I did in Florida, America can grow faster, too. But tax relief and reform is only part of what we must do. We still have to reduce the regulations that choke so much of the U.S. economy, especially farms, factories and power plants. We have to fix the broken immigration system so that it helps drive a growing economy. We have to take full advantage of America’s energy revolution. Finally, we have to transform the education system so that all children are prepared to succeed in college and at work, and participate fully in the economy we’re trying to build. Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.

Taken together, these policies will unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.

To achieve these policies, we have to change the way Washington works. And we have to change who we send there to lead. That’s what my economic plan will achieve, and that’s why I’m running for president.

Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Reforming Washington

READ MORE
We used to call this city “Mount Tallahassee” because it was so remote from the people, so caught up in the settled ways of a comfortable establishment. I was a governor who refused to go along with that establishment. I wasn’t a member of the club, and that made all the difference


Should I win this election, you will not find me deferring to the settled ways of “Mount Washington,” either. The overspending, the overreaching, the arrogance, and the sheer incompetence in that city – these problems have been with us so long that they are sometimes accepted as facts of life. But a president should never accept them, and I will not. We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital – and I mean to do it.

“We need a president willing to challenge the whole culture in our nation’s capital – and I mean to do it.”

Balanced Budget Amendment

From the very outset as president, I would signal a new direction by supporting fundamental reforms that go to the heart of the problem.

First, we have to confront and end the habitual practice of deficit spending. As long as deficits are an option, deficits will be the reality. The remedy that I will support as president is a balanced budget amendment. To be clear, a properly-designed amendment must be a tool to limit government – not raise taxes.

Americans in every party are right to be worried about the fiscal integrity and solvency of our government. It needs to be fixed. I will urge Congress to submit a balanced budget amendment to the states and let the people decide.

Second, it’s time to revive Veto Corleone. The president should be able to eliminate wasteful spending through a constitutionally sound line-item veto – such as the version that Congressman Paul Ryan has proposed.

Overspending is one of those problems where a president has to assert the national interest, even if no one else will.  The power to veto irresponsible spending is part of that duty, and I know how to use it.

Automatic Government

Too much in the federal government runs on automatic – which usually means that things are happening with no one stopping to ask why. We see this in the way the civil service operates. People are hired, promoted, and given pay increases often without regard to performance.

More than ever, it’s a system stuck in old ways, ruled by inertia, and unaccountable to the people. And with over two million employees on the federal payroll, these problems carry a heavy cost, and a few serious reforms will go a long way.

My first reform will be placing a freeze on federal hiring. We can expect more than 10 percent of the current federal workforce to retire over the next 5 years. It’s a fairly safe bet that not everyone who leaves has to be replaced.

04PV3RScreen Shot 2015-07-19 at 9.26.24 AM
We will go by a simple three-out, one-in rule across the federal workforce, with exceptions for critical positions related to our security and safety. Only one new hire for every three who leave.

This policy can, on its own, reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy by 10 percent within 5 years.

Combined with other reforms, reducing the size of the bureaucracy by 10 percent within 4 years is a realistic goal, saving tens of billions of dollars, and without adding to unemployment.

There are a lot of exemplary employees in the federal government, but they’re treated no better than the bad ones.  And the bad ones are almost impossible to effectively discipline or remove.

Job security is one thing, job entitlement is another, and every time a federal employee needs to be moved along it shouldn’t be a federal case.

I will also propose, along with merit pay, enhanced financial incentives for managers whose skill and careful planning actually reduce spending.

When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it – and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.

“When federal employees are found squandering public money, we should call them out on it – and when they find ways to save public money, we should reward them for it.”

Setting the Standard

In all of these reforms, it matters what example is set by those in elective office. It’s easy for elected officials to lay out standards of performance for others. But what are high standards worth if we don’t apply them to ourselves? Consider a pattern in Congress of members who sometimes seem to regard attendance and voting as optional – something to do as time permits.

The reality is that Congress is in session for three days in a typical week anyway, so it’s not asking too much that every member be there and work on those days. And if it’s an incentive they need, how about the one that pretty much every worker in America has in their job: you don’t show up, you don’t get paid for that time.

A bill to dock the pay of absentee members might not pass the House or Senate, but at least it would get them all there for a vote.  If we can’t always get them on the job, let’s at least get them on the record.

If I learned anything as Governor of Florida, it was never to take time for granted. I even kept on my desk, where I would always see it, a digital clock counting down the time left in my term to the last hour. I might just bring that clock along, should I have the honor of serving the 1,461 days of the next presidential term.

“Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year.”

But this era of excuses is drawing to an end. There’s some lost time to make up, and we can do it. Real economic growth is achievable, and I have set a goal of four percent a year. Balanced budgets, and debt that is finally under control, are also within our power to accomplish. And the driving force must be a presidential-level challenge to the culture of spending. This is essential and achievable in a single term – and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Defeating ISIS

READ MORE
Thank you very much.  It’s good to be with all of you, and I appreciate the kind hospitality of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

I bring greetings from the wonderful guy who is still very proud to have been Ronald Reagan’s vice president. A competition turned into friendship, and the better my Dad got to know Ronald Reagan, the more he admired and loved him.  On my way here this afternoon, I made a call to Nancy Reagan, to thank her for this honor and let her know how much we all love her.

Seven elections have come and gone since the Reagan name was last on the ballot.  Yet in many ways, that name, and the qualities it brings to mind, is still the standard.  A leader of clarity and resolve, not given to idle words, it was President Reagan who took command of events, rebuilt America’s strength, and moved the world toward peace. Strategically and morally, he conceded nothing to America’s enemies.  He believed that the Cold War could be won, not just endlessly managed, and in the end he put an age of conflict behind us.  They don’t always give out peace prizes for that, but peace is what Ronald Reagan left behind, and that is the legacy of a good and great man.

In our time as well, it is strength, and will, and clarity of purpose that make all the difference.  Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes.  We’ve seen in recent years how critical each one of these principles is to our security, because when it counted most, they were missing.

Good things happen when America is engaged with friends and allies, alert to danger, and resolved to deal with threats, before they become catastrophes.

To really grasp what the next president will face, we have to look candidly at a few policies that have gone very wrong in these years –above all, in what we used to call the global war on terror.  Despite elaborate efforts by the administration to avoid even calling it by name, one of the very gravest threats we face today comes from radical Islamic terrorists. The terrorists are possessed by the same violent ideology that gave us 9/11, and they are on the offensive and gaining ground.  It is not true, and was wishful thinking by the Administration to claim, that ‘the tide of war is receding.’

The reality is that radical Islam has been spreading like a pandemic – across the Middle East, throughout Africa and to parts of Asia, even in the nations of the West, finding recruits in Europe and the United States.

Here’s another stark reality: Seven years ago, the long-awaited jihadist caliphate existed only in the fevered imagination of the terrorists.  Today, the radicals’ caliphate exists as an actual place, occupying a stretch of land larger than Indiana.


ISIS, a genocidal terrorist army, controls large parts of two countries, and is gaining influence in others.  And yet well into this nightmare, President Obama’s administration, by its own admission, has no strategy to stop it.  In place of one, they are pursuing a minimalist approach of incremental escalation. The results have been a creeping U.S. involvement, without any strategic results – the worst of both worlds.

A year of limited strikes and other half-measures has made little discernible difference in the sum total of the ISIS danger. A halting, ineffective effort against them has only emboldened these terrorists, leaving the pandemic unchecked.

Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, and other cities that American and allied troops died to liberate, are now under the black flag of ISIS.  Inside the caliphate, non-believers are forced to convert, and those who do not, can expect a horrible fate. A special hatred is reserved for Christians and other religious minorities.  In the Middle East today, we are witnessing a mass persecution and exodus of the followers of Jesus Christ.  Nor is any allowance made for adherents of Islam found lacking in zeal by ISIS, which has filled mass graves with innocent Muslims.

Potential recruits of ISIS, ready for their own taste of violence, can even follow it all on social media. It’s a time when mass murderers have Twitter handles, Facebook and Instagram pages, using these to add a veneer of glamor to their exploits.  We need to work with the owners of the relevant companies, and give careful thought to how we address this problem.

Among followers worldwide, ISIS is hailed as the strong horse, the glorious cleanser and restorer of Islam, and that word is getting out on Western-based social media.  This helps explain the spread of ISIS and the terrorist pandemic in the Middle East and beyond, including thousands recruited from Europe, and more than a hundred from America, giving us ISIS terrorists with Western passports.

The Islamic State and its followers are an asymmetric threat –needing just one big strike to inflict devastation. What we are facing in ISIS and its ideology is, to borrow a phrase, the focus of evil in the modern world.  And civilized nations everywhere, especially those with power, have a duty to oppose and defeat this enemy.

No leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region, Iraq especially.  Yet in a long experience that includes failures of intelligence and military setbacks, one moment stands out in memory as the turning point we had all been waiting for.  And that was the surge of military and diplomatic operations that turned events toward victory.  It was a success, brilliant, heroic, and costly.  And this nation will never forget the courage and sacrifice that made it all possible.

So why was the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq, leaving not even the residual force that commanders and the joint chiefs knew was necessary?  That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill – and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.  ISIS grew while the United States disengaged from the Middle East and ignored the threat.  And where was Secretary of State Clinton in all of this?  Like the president himself, she had opposed the surge, then joined in claiming credit for its success, then stood by as that hard-won victory by American and allied forces was thrown away. In all her record-setting travels, she stopped by Iraq exactly one time.


Who can seriously argue that America and our friends are safer today than in 2009, when the President and Secretary Clinton – the storied ‘team of rivals’ – took office?  So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers.  It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else’s problem.  Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.

All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone.  Another terrible miscalculation, unfolding right now, is a different story.  That would be the Obama-Clinton-Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force in the region when in fact they are deceitful dictators causing nothing but instability.

Whenever bad things happen in the Middle East, from Israel’s borders to the shores of Yemen, the influence of the mullahs is rarely far from the scene.  Here is a regime that supports terrorism, threatens to destroy Israel, has for years been trying to develop nuclear weapons, routinely commits human rights violations, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq, and even now is unlawfully detaining American citizens.

Iran, its ally Assad, its terrorist proxy Hizballah, and the sectarian militias it sponsors have fueled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, that have helped give rise to ISIS. Yet the president’s deal with Iran confronts none of these problems.  And least of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.  In fact the deal prepares the way for that capability. With the lifting of sanctions, the deal also frees up more than 100 billion dollars for Iran’s security services to use as they wish.  In effect, the primary investors in a violent, radical Middle East have just received a new round of funding, courtesy of the United States and the United Nations.

And, this is President Obama’s idea of a diplomatic triumph. It is a deal unwise in the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme. It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America.

It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America.

If the Congress does not reject this deal, then the damage must be undone by the next president – and it will be my intention to begin that process immediately. Knowing what has gone wrong, however, is not the same as knowing how to set it right.

The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity, and confidence that only American leadership can provide.  Radical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming, and I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected President of the United States.  We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace.  Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail.

In all of this, the United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the most populous Arab country and the wealthiest, are important partners of the United States.  Those relationships have been badly mishandled by this administration.  Both countries are key to a better-coordinated regional effort against terrorism.  We need to restore trust, and work more closely with them against common threats. We have very capable partners, likewise, in the United Arab Emirates, who are willing and able to take the fight to the extremists.  We have a moderate and quite formidable leader in King Abdullah of Jordan.  We have an ally in the new democratic government in Tunisia, and a fragile democracy in Lebanon – nations that are both under assault by radicals and terrorists.  Across the region, responsible governments need no persuading of what the moment requires.

It requires action, coordination, and American leadership to bring it all together.  My strategy meets the unique circumstances in each of the two countries, Iraq and Syria, in which ISIS now has territory.  And let’s start with Iraq, and the five broad actions I would take as president to help remove the threat from that country.

IraqStrategy_New1
First, we must support the Iraqi forces, which right now have the will to win, but not the means.  As matters stand, the United States has been helping to reconstitute Iraqi security services and to aid the Kurdish peshmerga.  We need to broaden and expedite our efforts to help ensure Iraqis rebuild their security sector – not only to win against ISIS, but to break free of Iranian influence.  And that effort should also involve even greater engagement with the Sunni tribes, whose fighting units served side-by-side with Americans to defeat al-Qaeda-in-Iraq and were then disbanded by the Maliki government.

IraqStrategy_New2
Second, we must give these forces the consistent advantage of American air power, to cover their operations and to strike with fierce precision.  The strategy has to include forward air controllers, whose skill and accuracy would severely hinder the enemy’s freedom of movement.  This would greatly improve the ability of fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to provide necessary close air support to local ground forces. ISIS fighters try blending into the civilian landscape.  Our spotters on the ground will enable us to hit them hard and rarely miss.

IraqStrategy_New3
Third, we must make better use of the limited forces we have by giving them a greater range of action.  Right now, we have around 3,500 soldiers and marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed.  We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces.  But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country. Our unrivaled warfighters know that it is simply not enough to dispense advice and training to local forces, then send them on their way and hope for the best.  Canadian troops are already embedded in Iraqi units to very good effect.  Our soldiers and marines need the go-ahead to do that as well, to help our partners outthink and outmaneuver the enemy.

IraqStrategy_New4
Fourth, we should providemore support to the Kurds, giving them decisive military power against ISIS.  In Iraq’s Kurdish region, we have loyal friends and brave and skilled fighters.  If I am commander in chief, the United States will make certain that the Kurds have everything they need to win.

IraqStrategy_New5
And finally, our strategy in Iraq has to restart the serious diplomatic efforts that can help that country move in the right direction.  Only Iraq’s Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can decide if they will live together and share power and resources in a way that will serve their interests, assuring the survival of their country.  But these partners have to know that while the United States is there in measure, we are also there in earnest and for the long haul.  They will come through for their country, but they’ve got to be certain that we have their back.

Now, the situation in Syria is quite different from the one in Iraq.  In some ways, it is even more complex because we have no large, cohesive force to work with.  And here, too, we have seen what ruin and suffering can follow when America doesn’t lead.

Of 23 million Syrians, about 11 million have been displaced or fled the country altogether.  More than two hundred thousand people have so far been killed in the mayhem.  The regime of Bashar al-Assad is deploying every ruthless means to stay in power.  Long brutalized by that regime, now under assault from ISIS, Syrian moderates want to fight against both enemies, and they view the regime as the greater evil.  It’s a sorrowful picture when you think back on how it could have been avoided.

Exactly four years ago, we heard words that still hang in the air of the Middle East – when President Obama declared that ‘the time has come for President Assad to step aside.’  Then, three years ago, came another pronouncement – that any use of chemical weapons by Assad would be a ‘red line,’ inviting tough consequences for the regime.

If the choice was between silence and these idle, grandiose words, it would have been better to say nothing at all.  What followed is that Assad used those weapons, again and again, and there were no serious consequences whatsoever.  Having lost our credibility on such an epic scale, it is hard to get it back.  But we had better try, because the longer we do nothing, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and the more directly our friends and our interests are threatened.

Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse.

Our ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long-term political stability in that country.  Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its plan-less aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi.  Syria will need a stable government, and a transition free of more sectarian blood-letting will depend on the credible moderate forces we help unite and build up today.  To that end, my strategy would bring American influence to bear in four all-important areas of action.

SyriaStrategy_New1
First, a coordinated, international effort is essential to give Syria’s moderate forces the upper hand.  As it is, the Qataris, the Turks, the Saudis, and others have been supporting fighting groups in Syria.  But these groups are not always working to common purpose.  And if there’s anything that moderate forces in Syria cannot afford right now it’s confusion and disunity.

Under my strategy, the aim would be to draw the moderates together and back them up, as one force.  And we should back that force up all the way through – not just in taking the fight to the enemy, but in helping them to form a stable, moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone.  It’s a tough, complicated diplomatic and military proposition, even more so than the current situation in Iraq.  But it can be done. We saw in the Iraq surge how Islamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces.  And the strategic elements in both cases are the same – we have to support local forces, and we must stay true to our word.

SyriaStrategy_New2
Second, we have to expand and vastly improve the recruitment and training of Syrian forces fighting ISIS.  At the moment, too many in Syria doubt that they can count on us, which explains why our recruiting and training have basically come to nothing.  When a five hundred million dollar program gets you 54 recruits, you know the plan’s not working out.  The reality is, our recruitment efforts have been failing in Syria because we are not respected anymore as a reliable actor in the region.  And we have to change that impression with the kind of clear, consistent, and credible action that every nation should expect from the United States of America.

SyriaStrategy_New3
Third, we must over time establish multiple safe zones in Syria.  It’s a measure of progress that we have joined with the Turks to create a small, ‘ISIS-free zone’ in the northern part of the country.  But we need to go beyond well this, by establishing safe zones to protect Syrians not only from ISIS, but also from Assad.

SyriaStrategy_New4
Fourth, we and our partners should declare a no-fly zone in Syria, and then work to expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime.  Enforce that no-fly zone, and we’ll stop the regime’s bombing raids that kill helpless civilians.  It could also keep Iranian flights from resupplying the regime, Hizballah, and other bad actors.  A no-fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it.

When we talk about no-fly zones in Syria, precision airstrikes in Iraq, or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats, all of this assumes that such power is there when we need it. Yet here as well, the shortsightedness of the present administration will leave a cost.  We are in the seventh year of a significant dismantling of our own military, in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying.  And I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America.

A winning strategy against the Islamic State, or against any threat to ourselves and our friends, depends ultimately on the military strength that underwrites American influence.  Let that slip away, and what would America be in world affairs, except one more well-intentioned voice at the United Nations?  In any effort of ours to overcome violence and secure peace, a winning strategy depends on maintaining unequaled strength, and we can never take it for granted.

I might add that this includes strength among our intelligence services, military and civilian.  No men and women receive so little credit for doing so much to track dangers and keep us safe.  These skilled and brave Americans can be sure of this: If I become commander in chief, they will receive the tools they need and the gratitude, respect, and support they deserve.

A good many people who serve in our military and intelligence agencies are at mid-career.  And I venture to guess that for quite a few of them, their calling has something to do with their coming of age in the Reagan years.  Yet any nostalgia for that time has to recall, not only a falling wall and collapsing evil empire, but also the fear, and tension, and dead-serious challenges that could all have played out so very differently.  From the distance of decades, even the greatest successes in security and foreign policy can look almost inevitable.  Of course, nothing had to happen as it did.  Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it.  But then along came, one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most.

It’s that way for us too, in having to deal with long conflicts and serious threats that are again on the offensive.  And in living up to our responsibilities, we can always use a little more of the Reagan spirit – rejecting with contempt the idea that conflict must be endless, or that the spread of danger and violence is inevitable.  It is not.

For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace.  This is the way forward in our time as well, led by a president who is resolute – as I will be – in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears.

For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace.

We can protect our people, put adversaries back in retreat, get things moving our way again, and win back the momentum for freedom’s cause.  In all of this, let us never forget that in fighting evil, we are doing good; in stopping the merciless, we are delivering justice; and in destroying the violent, we are defending the innocent.

This is the work that America is in this world to do.  Let us meet that duty with confidence, faith, and resolve.

Thank you very much.

Border Security

READ MORE
When Clint Bolick and I published Immigration Wars in 2013, we presented a number of proposals to strengthen America’s immigration policy. Border security and the interior enforcement of immigration laws, including a greater role for states, formed key parts of this package of reforms. We emphasized that finding a practical solution to the status of the people who are here illegally today is a nonstarter if our borders are not secure against future illegal immigration.

I believe that for those already in the country, we need to put in place a rigorous path that requires individuals to pass a thorough criminal background check, pay fines, pay taxes, learn English, obtain a provisional work permit and work, not receive federal government assistance, and over an extended period of time earn legal status. But any plan to address the status of illegal immigrants must be accompanied by a robust strategy to improve border security.

Securing the border is possible, but it will require Washington to move beyond divisive rhetoric. The following six proposals offer concrete steps that the federal government should take to help secure the border and enforce our immigration laws. We must transform immigration from a broken system into one that benefits every American.

Border Security

1. A forward-leaning Border Patrol with the flexibility to deploy resources to meet threats.

In some cases, it takes Border Patrol agents over an hour to get to the remote and rugged areas they need to patrol. Creating more forward-operating bases maximizes agents’ time on the border by stationing them there (much like a fire station) for multiple days at a time. We also have to interdict drugs and people as close to the border as possible by using quick reaction teams that go after the threat the moment it crosses the border. An approach to border security that waits until illicit traffic is miles into the interior of the country effectively cedes sovereign U.S. territory to the cartels and smugglers. These forward-leaning Border Patrol agents should be at the front line of a multi-layered “defense in depth” where additional lines of defense increase the likelihood of detecting and apprehending illegal crossers.

The Border Patrol also must have the flexibility to deploy resources as needed. The flow of illegal immigrants can and will shift over time. For example, in the mid-2000s, the Tucson, Arizona sector saw the most traffic based on the number of apprehensions; after we applied more resources, people went to less secure areas of the border, such as the Rio Grande Valley sector in South Texas. Our border security posture must be as nimble as the cartels’ ability to shift operations to a different area.

2. Use new technologies to achieve continuous surveillance of the border.

Having the ability to detect illegal crossings is necessary to secure the border. In order to apprehend a person, you first have to know when and where a crossing occurs. That is one of the biggest problems right now—we do not have enough surveillance on the border and we are being beaten without knowing it. We can leverage technology to constantly watch the border, develop intelligence, and put our agents and resources where they are most effective at preventing and apprehending illicit border crossers.

Technology, such as drones, advanced sensors, and radar, can give our agents a fuller picture of the illegal activity that in turn will enable the country to better allocate resources on the border. More than that, technology can make securing the border safer for our agents who will not have to respond to false alarms. And because the cartels do extensive counter-surveillance on our agents through the use of spotters who report on the movement of the Border Patrol, we need to keep them guessing by using mobile technology.

3. Bolster border infrastructure and improve access to federal lands.

Road construction and maintenance can provide agents access to areas of the border that would otherwise go unpatrolled. New roads are needed on the border to secure access to remote and rugged terrain to interdict smugglers, and respond to the detection of illicit traffic by technology. Likewise, new boat ramps can provide Border Patrol riverine units more points to put their vessels in the water so they can patrol more effectively.

As noted in Immigration Wars, fencing is a component of border security. When combined with surveillance technology and agents to detect and respond to crossings, fencing or other barriers can serve several purposes, including: (1) deterring illegal entries by making it more difficult to cross the border, (2) facilitating enforcement by increasing the time available to respond and apprehend people, and (3) steering dangerous criminals and traffickers away from populated areas, improving public safety. Sufficient funding should be provided to maintain, improve, and expand fences where appropriate (e.g., based on the terrain along the border or the proximity of populated areas).

Access to federal lands is another key part of improving access to border areas. Currently, agents have to navigate byzantine environmental rules and regulations to access federal lands, which make up a large portion of the southwest border. Removing these restrictions would help untie the hands of our agents to patrol every inch of the border.

Interior Enforcement

4. Require electronic verification of employment eligibility.

Many illegal immigrants come to the United States for jobs and, despite the prohibition on hiring illegal immigrants, they are hired in large numbers. If we decrease the likelihood of being employed, crossing the border will be less rewarding. However, the current I-9 system does not effectively prevent the hiring of illegal workers. We need a strong E-Verify system to ensure that American businesses are not hiring illegal immigrants. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. Employers should not be penalized if they use E-Verify in good faith and receive an incorrect eligibility confirmation. Identity theft protections are also necessary. Finally, with an improved E-Verify, the government must enforce penalties for violations.

5. Identify and send home the people who are entering the United States and overstaying their visas or otherwise violating the terms of their admission.

In its widely-cited 2006 review, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that nearly half of all illegal immigrants living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport and overstayed their visas. While we need to find a practical solution to the status of people who are here illegally today, as we secure the border going forward, we also need to identify and send home the people who enter the country legally but overstay their visas or otherwise violate the terms of their admission.

Unfortunately, without a system in place to track adequately who has actually left the country, it is difficult to know who these individuals are. A biometric exit system must be rapidly implemented so that immigration and national security officials know with certainty who is, and is not, in this country.

We also need to increase federal resources dedicated to overstay enforcement. In FY 2012, the federal agency that investigates overstay cases, among other activities, spent less than 2 percent of their time on these cases.

Furthermore, we need to create intergovernmental task forces to locate and apprehend overstays, especially those who present public safety risks. With proper training and supervision, state and local police could augment federal agents because they know their communities and have more boots on the ground.

6. Crack down on sanctuary cities that undermine efforts to enforce immigration laws.

We should withhold federal law enforcement funds for cities that undermine federal immigration laws and make sure we detain and deport illegal immigrants who are serious criminals. We should also expand federal partnerships that train state and local police to help enforce immigration laws, particularly in jails and prisons. When I was Governor of Florida, the state was a trailblazer in working with the federal government to enforce immigration laws. In 2002, Florida signed the first agreement with the federal government under the Section 287(g) program, which trains state and local police to help enforce immigration laws.

These six proposals, when combined with a rigorous path to earned legal status, would realistically and honestly address the status of the 11 million people here illegally today and protect against future illegal immigration. While passions run high on this issue, there is no rational plan to deport millions of people that the American people would support. It would disrupt communities and families and could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. The policies I am advocating can ultimately receive bipartisan support in Congress and become law. President Obama has had six-and-a-half years to address our broken immigration system. Instead of leading the nation towards consensus, he has divided the country. One has to ask whether he is more interested in providing a wedge issue for his party than offering a solution for the country. There should be no doubt where I stand. I am committed to addressing the problem of illegal immigration in a comprehensive fashion so we can respond to the legitimate concerns of the American people and build stronger support for legal immigration, which if done properly can be a catalyst to bring us to strong, sustained economic growth that will benefit every American.

At the core of America’s military strength are the men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces. We have no greater asset than our service members or greater responsibility than ensuring they are well provided for – while they are in uniform and throughout their lives.

Recent revelations of grave conditions at facilities throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs’ health care system have brought to light the failed leadership of the Obama Administration to serve those who have served our nation.


Reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), fixing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and improving services to veterans across the board must be a top priority for the next President of the United States.

Jeb’s Florida Record:

Florida has the third largest veterans population in the country. As Governor, Jeb made military families and veterans a signature issue. He increased the number of state veterans’ homes from two to six. He increased property tax exemptions for disabled veterans (from $500 to $5,000) and eliminated the fee to get a disabled parking permit. Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature created an employment advocacy and assistance program for military spouses and dependents.

He also passed laws that provide free undergraduate tuition at state colleges and universities to Florida recipients of the Purple Heart (and combat-related decorations ranked superior in precedence to the Purple Heart) and their children.

Jeb can reform veterans’ services and care and expand opportunities for them because he’s done it before.

Jeb can reform veterans’ services and care and expand opportunities for them because he’s done it before.

Jeb’s Seven-Step Plan to Keep America’s Promises to Our Veterans:

• Improve the Veterans Health Administration by Enhancing Care and Expanding Veterans Choice
• Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality Services
• Modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs
• Create More Opportunities for Veterans
• Restore Military Troop Levels
• Improve Healthcare for Female Veterans
• Honor Veterans’ Service

Overhaul the Veterans Health Administration to Expand Veterans’ Choices and Enhance Care

Taxpayers entrust the Veterans Health Administration to care for our returning warriors. Unfortunately, the VA is long overdue for reform and a recommitment to its core mission. Veterans should be treated by a doctor and at a clinic of their choosing, not at the discretion of federal bureaucrats. Those who choose to use the VA system must have timely access to top-notch medical services.

Jeb’s Plan

Currently, only certain veterans are allowed to choose their doctor – those who can’t get an appointment within 30 days and those living 40 miles or more from a VA health facility. That number should be broadened and limitations to private access reduced. If a veteran wants to see a neighborhood physician, he or she has earned that choice. The VA must remain the guarantor of that choice and that care.


The challenge in expanding the choice program is in the cost and outreach. Approximately 30,000 veterans have opted to use the program, a paltry number given the nearly 9 million veterans who use VA hospitals. Though the program is still new, the VA has not sufficiently encouraged veterans to participate. Cost is also a problem. Although total VA funding grew by nearly 73 percent since 2009, the VA ran out of money in 2015. While it is unconscionable that the VA still can’t afford to provide reasonable options for veterans, the fact remains that choice is expensive and there needs to be a way to pay for it.

With budgetary concerns in mind, increasing choice cannot come at the expense of veterans receiving care at the VA. Despite well-documented problems with VA administrators, many veterans prefer to receive their care at VA hospitals. And many VA facilities specialize in care like post-traumatic stress, traumatic brain injury, and prosthetics.

“We don’t have the money” is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.

“We don’t have the money” is not an acceptable answer when it comes to providing choice and care to veterans. This is a problem of priorities, not funding.

The solution is to reform the VA, and redirect those savings into veterans care. This includes cutting excess administrators (not caregivers) through Jeb’s ‘3-out, 1-in’ proposal, and improving practices so that we eliminate billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, we must fire bureaucrats who refuse to make bidding for VA contracts competitive (as required by law), improve whistleblower protections –by accelerating the conferring of whistleblower status and disciplining bosses who retaliate against whistleblowers– and remove the VA from missions unrelated to veteran services, such as construction. A whistleblower said that the VA misspent as much as $5 billion in outside care contracts that did not meet requirements for competition. Those funds were misspent in violation of federal law, and included gross overpayments in pharmaceuticals, services, and procurement.

Ample resources exist within the VA budget to improve the quality and scope of care. Annual targets for reform savings and choice expansion should be set. Targeted increases in choice would be tied to savings achieved through reform. In other government agencies, commonsense reforms have saved billions. The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.

The VA must get its house in order, and send savings into improving veteran choice and veteran care.

Further, steps must be made to address the wait list for care. Congress and Veteran Service Organizations have put several proposals forth to lower the wait for appointments, and many of them are worthy of careful consideration. In the short term, VA pharmacies should be allowed to fill prescriptions from outside doctors. The current practice requires that all medication be approved in-house, often requiring a VA doctor to confirm the opinion of a veteran’s private doctor. This is a redundancy that extends wait times for veterans in need.

Hold Government Accountable for Providing Quality Services

The VA Secretary said last year, “I can’t just walk into the room and fire someone.” If a VA employee is guilty of incompetence severe enough that a veteran loses his life, the Secretary should be able to do exactly that.

The problem is that the VA, like the federal government writ large, is beholden to both complex union contracts and a broken civil service system. These impediments make it nearly impossible for managers to discipline or fire employees. According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, it takes an average of six months to a year to fire a government employee. And after firing, the employee can appeal that decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  Then the MSPB process can add many more months before finality of the employment action.

The Veterans Choice Access and Accountability Act of 2014 created a new way to remove career Senior Executives (SES), based upon performance or misconduct within the Department. Unfortunately, the law only applies to Senior Executive Service (SES) employees — roughly 370 of VA’s 300,000-employee workforce.

Jeb’s Plan

It will take the will of leadership to truly hold employees accountable, which thus far has not been demonstrated by President Obama’s Administration.

The firing authority provided by the Choice Act should apply to all VA employees, especially those who engage in any conduct that results in a lapse of care for a veteran, or are responsible for waste, fraud, and abuse. Further, paid administrative leave for disciplinary investigations should be limited to 14 days per year.

Quote_FiringAuthority
The VA has also treated whistleblowers shamefully. To correct this, the timeline for deciding whistleblower status should be accelerated, new whistleblower protections added, and new disciplinary procedures for managers who retaliate against whistleblowers should be established.

Further reforms to the SES at VA are needed. This should include the ability to rescind an employee’s pension if convicted of a felony related to VA, and the authority to rescind a bonus at any time.

The point is not to simply punish those who fail, but reward the overwhelming number of VA employees who have devoted their lives to serving veterans. If a VA employee fails in his or her mission, to ‘care for those who have borne the battle,’ they must step aside or be removed so that talented employees can rise up.

Modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs

The VA still operates under archaic practices and procedures, despite spending around $4Bn on information technology annually. It has struggled to adapt to the 21st century. In an era of high speed Internet, revolutionary advances in medicine, fiber optics and interconnectivity, the VA can still take months to deliver care and responses that could be transmitted in seconds.

Jeb’s Plan

One of the key problems with the wait-list manipulation scandal in 2014 was that the VA relied on an antiquated and unreliable scheduling software system. The software was old and susceptible to falsification. New software is more than capable of eliminating those vulnerabilities and improving the VA user experience.

In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle. The current online system is difficult to use, especially for older veterans.

In this day and age, veterans should be able to login, make or cancel an appointment, and check on the status of that appointment with little hassle.

There are also obstacles to refilling prescriptions online, a feature available at most pharmacies nationwide. While the VA does have a system set up for online prescription refills, it is poorly designed. The VA should explore public-private partnerships to replace shoddy software.

Veterans have gone too long without a secure online credential that proves their status as veterans. The current system requires a paper copy of the DD-214, a form used to verify service and military discharge. The VA should team with the private sector to create a single, safe credential for veterans that verifies their service and eligibility for benefits.

This credential would be provided as they separate from service. Such credentialing could allow a faster admission to veterans eligible for the choice program, allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online. In person, a veteran should be able to pull out a smart phone and prove their service with a few touches of the screen.

The problems at the VA are not purely software issues. While it has failed to adapt as quickly as it should to technological advances, the VA still uses out-of-date practices that have outlived their usefulness.

An obvious example is that of hospital construction. A new hospital in Denver, Colorado was estimated at $800 million in construction costs. A new estimate is $1.7 billion dollars, nearly a billion over budget. The VA has no business being in the construction industry. It should stick to tending to the wounded. The practice is outmoded and would be better accomplished by more relevant federal agencies.

Create More Opportunities for Veterans

While veterans’ unemployment has dropped in recent years, nearly 600,000 veterans were still unemployed in 2014. Almost 550 service-members transition from the military daily, and approximately one million veterans will rejoin civilian society in the next 3-5 years.

Jeb’s Plan

Only 48 percent of working age veterans use their GI Bill benefits, and only 52 percent of those veterans complete their field of study. But veterans are 45 percent more likely to be self-employed than non-veterans, and $1.2 trillion in sales is generated from 2.4 million veteran-owned businesses – which represent nearly 9 percent of all U.S. small businesses.

A way to both reduce underuse and misuse of GI benefits is to allow the GI bill to be used to insure a small business loan. Eligible veterans could borrow against their earned GI bill benefits to start a small business, in lieu of using it for education.

Restore Troop Levels

While veterans’ benefits have rightly been protected from the Budget Control Act and Sequestration, the impact has still been felt at VA facilities. Active duty members of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force) hit a high point in 2010 with 1.4 million members. Under current defense cuts, it is set to drop to 1.2 million by 2019.

Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.

Put plainly, that means an additional 190,000 troops will be shed on top of natural attrition over the next four years. This is a heavy swell of new potential VA users.

Jeb’s Plan

While the military cuts should be reversed for purely strategic security reasons, the fact stands that the sheer number of service members leaving service is overwhelming the VA. The Pentagon needs more soldiers and the VA is inundated with new veterans. Ending the rapid troop drawdown is a simple, pragmatic solution to both problems.

Improve Healthcare for Female Veterans

Fully 15 percent of active duty and 18 percent of National Guard and Reserves forces are women, with projections saying those percentages will grow. In contrast, the percentage of women in uniform was just 2 percent in 1950. Under modern combat policies, women are serving in hostile areas in increasing numbers and are incurring critical injuries at levels similar to their male counterparts.

However, since the VHA has been historically orientated to care for men, women have received fewer immunizations, fewer cancer screenings, and fewer mental health screenings than their male counterparts.

Jeb’s Plan

It’s time to improve healthcare services for female veterans. That starts by preparing for the further growth in the female veterans population with responsive programs in organization, staff, and training – including in obstetrics, gynecology, and specializations in ovarian and breast cancer.

The agency underwent an assessment in 2012 to measure the quality of care for the growing population of female veterans. That was a welcome step. However, more must be done, particularly when it comes to engaging the female veterans population and making them aware of the care options available to them, including in the area of mental health services as the long-term behavioral health effects of traumatic brain injury and PTSD are not yet known.

Military service members will be facing these challenges long after they have separated and will require care as veterans. The VA needs to ramp their behavioral health services and resources.

Honor Veterans’ Service

One obstacle to a successful transition from military to civilian life is the stereotype of the wounded, helpless vet overcome with issues like anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Many well-intentioned programs have unintentionally fed into the narrative of the “broken hero.” Polling suggests this has had a tangible effect on an employer’s willingness to hire veterans, despite the fact that they generally outperform non-veterans in the workplace.

Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that.

Jeb’s Plan

Jeb is committed to using the bully pulpit of a national election and his presidency to honor the service and character of America’s veterans. Their many virtues –commitment, loyalty, reliability, and integrity— will be highlighted, as well as how those merits inject value into communities and businesses. Organizations like Team Rubicon and Hire Heroes recognize that the best way to help veterans is to offer them a noble purpose and the dignity of a rewarding career. They should be acknowledged. Restoring the respect that veterans have earned requires national leadership, and Jeb is well positioned to offer precisely that. This will be a priority of his first term in office and beyond.

Regulatory Reform

READ MORE
Regulations are choking America’s economy, imposing an invisible tax of $1.9 trillion every year – that’s $15,000 per family.

1.88 Tril
During his time in the White House, President Obama has added roughly $3,100 per second in regulatory burdens to the economy.

EverySecond
Think what America could be and the prosperity we could experience if we took off the shackles from government rules and rule makers. My goal as president would be to set new, reasonable standards for the government agencies that issue rules that choke economic activity and opportunity.

As president, I will use my executive authority to do the following:

First, we will require regulators to live within a budget – for every one dollar of regulatory cost they propose, they will need to also propose ways to save an equivalent dollar through regulatory relief. We will implement a “one in, one out” regulatory budget.  A rule like this would have avoided roughly $99 billion in regulatory costs over the Obama presidency.

Second, we will enhance and enforce presidential control over regulations. Regulations will not be issued unless regulators have identified a major market or policy failure that new regulations are likely to solve. They will need to show that state-based solutions are insufficient and that benefits outweigh costs. And we will expect regulators to strictly adhere to the plain, ordinary meaning of constitutional and statutory limitations. I will also sign the REINS Act into law, empowering Congress to approve or reject, through a simple majority vote, regulations that impose outsized burdens on the economy.

Additional Materials On This Policy:

Videos and RemarksOp EdsDownloadsLatest Content
Third, we will establish a two-year deadline for completing federal permitting process – including environmental impact reviews — for major infrastructure projects that are mired in delays stretching up to a decade or more. We will get highway, port, bridge and other critical projects going, creating jobs and growing our economy.

Loosing Time
Last we will repeal or reform the most onerous Obama rules and regulations. That starts with:

Dodd-Frank
Waters of the United States Rule
The Carbon Rule
The Coal Ash Rule
Net Neutrality
Together, we will role back the surging tide of regulations that have overtaken us the last 6 and a half years.

Energy Policy For Growth

READ MORE
Unleash the Energy Revolution

Americans continue to endure anemic economic growth of barely 2% a year. For most people, it continues to be too hard to find a good paying job, get a raise or simply make ends meet. Some call this “the new normal,” but it is unacceptable.  With the right policies and leadership, we can, in the near-term, achieve 4% growth and restore the opportunity for every American to rise. But that will only happen if we reverse damaging federal energy policies.

The Energy Revolution and Growth

Energy is not just a sector of our economy. It is also an input into every other economic sector. That means cheaper, more reliable energy benefits American families in multiple ways. More domestic energy leads to more jobs, higher wages, lower gas prices and smaller electricity bills. In short, it means more money in people’s pockets, allowing them more freedom to make more choices for themselves and their children.

Current federal energy policies impose Washington, DC’s will on how states, tribes, businesses and families produce and use energy. In spite of this, the United States has managed to benefit over the last several years from an American innovation. A combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling is transforming the United States into a global energy superpower. For instance, since 2008, U.S. crude oil output has increased by over 80%, an increase of over 4 million barrels a day. That is the fastest increase in U.S. history. Even with the recent slowdown in production due to lower energy prices, America will continue to produce vastly more oil and gas than it has in decades, with corresponding economic and strategic benefits.

A Once-in-a-Generation Economic Opportunity

EnergyRevolution_Graphics-05The U.S. is still in the early stages of capitalizing on this economic opportunity. The Energy Revolution creates jobs in the oil and gas fields. Researchers at Dartmouth University found that every $1 million of oil and gas extracted from an oil or gas well generates, within 100 miles of that well, an additional $263,000 in wages and 2.8 new jobs. It also creates jobs throughout the oil and gas supply chain. For example, diesel engines that drive drilling rigs in Texas are largely manufactured in the U.S. heartland including in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan.

A Manufacturing Renaissance, a million new jobs

However, job creation extends well beyond the oil and gas industry and its suppliers. A Harvard Business School/Boston Consulting Group study asserts, “We believe that the single-largest source of competitive advantage and economic opportunity for the United States over the next decade or two is likely to be energy”. Cheaper energy can reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. The result, more Americans find work.

PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts the cheaper energy produced by the Energy Revolution will result in the creation of 930,000 new manufacturing jobs by 2030 and 1.41 million by 2040.

An Energy Plan for Americans to Rise

1. Lift Restrictions on Exports of Oil and Natural Gas

Current law bans the export of crude oil and makes it difficult to export natural gas to non-Free Trade Agreement countries such as Japan, China and the European Union.

Lifting the ban on crude oil exports and liberalizing natural gas exports would create hundreds of thousands of additional jobs and significantly lower net energy costs within two years. For instance, estimates from various studies indicate retail gasoline prices would drop by approximately 6 cents a gallon within 2 to 3 years of lifting the crude oil ban.

2. Approve the Keystone XL Pipeline

EnergyRevolution_Graphics-04President Obama and Hillary Clinton have baldly politicized the government permitting process by opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. After seven years and an unprecedented level of environmental review, there is now no credible reason for the President to stand in the way of this privately-funded project. Its approval would increase GDP by over $3 billion and support 42,000 jobs while the pipeline is under construction. Once built, it will be an essential piece of infrastructure more safely and cheaply moving both Canadian and U.S. resources to consumers.

3. Reduce Overregulation

Energy resources must be developed in a way that protects human health and the environment. Rules play an important role in making sure this is the case. But the Obama Administration’s excessive rules too often usurp state and tribal authority and go beyond what is necessary.

Overregulation affects energy directly and indirectly. Some new rules, such as overwriting state and tribal standards for hydraulic fracturing operations, directly discourage investment in domestic oil and gas operations. Other, broader regulations, such as Obama’s Carbon Rule, attempt to impose the President’s conception of how everyone should produce and consume energy.

The damaging effect such heavy-handed regulation has, not only on energy security but on American households, is largely hidden to the average consumer. For instance, unless it is quickly addressed by the courts, in the near-term, Obama’s Carbon Rule will increase electricity prices for everyone and threaten the system’s reliability.

Obama’s Carbon Rule will increase electricity prices for everyone and threaten the system’s reliability

Perhaps worse, such regulation saps America’s dynamism. We have, thus far, benefited from the Energy Revolution simply because Washington did not have time to quash it, but we will never know how many other innovations have been lost due to overregulation.

Addressing this regulatory mess requires a president willing to restore regulators’ accountability to the American people.  A week ago, I proposed significant reforms that will broadly improve the rulemaking process. Because affordable energy is so important to American families and our economy, rules and permitting practices that unnecessarily suppress domestic energy production and raise prices need to be immediately addressed by the next president. Some, such as Obama’s Carbon Rule, need to be stopped in their tracks.

Rules and permitting practices that unnecessarily suppress domestic energy production and raise prices need to be immediately addressed by the next President.

4. Defer to Willing States and Tribes

At least two states, Alaska and Virginia, have expressed an interest in further developing energy resources but have been thwarted or constrained by the Obama Administration. For instance, Alaskans overwhelmingly want to develop onshore and offshore energy resources in or near their state. Yet the President has severely limited the extent to which these lands can be explored and developed. Even more extreme, Hillary Clinton has indicated she would flatly prohibit drilling off the northern coast of Alaska.

This must change. Washington should generally defer to the will of states and tribes. Their citizens and leaders are best able to weigh the benefits and costs of oil and gas development.

Sustaining Growth

Once achieved, the nation must maintain higher growth with energy policies that continue to increase jobs and lower costs over the long-term. In the coming months, I will release additional proposals that will complement our status as an energy superpower by revitalizing our position as the superpower of energy innovation.

For instance, we can further accelerate the discovery of game-changing technologies by boosting funding for high-priority basic research and increasing the effectiveness of our national labs. The private sector often underfunds energy research that could greatly benefit society. Government can correct that. My record and experience in Florida shows how world-class research contributes to jobs and technological advances that can improve everyone’s quality of life.

IMG_3256
laughing with factory people

In addition, we must create a level playing field for all energy sources including, but not limited to, nuclear, renewables, coal, natural gas, oil and alternative fuels. We unnecessarily drive up energy costs on Americans when we play favorites and suppress the dynamism of free markets.

Further, producers and consumers must have better access to new technologies such as “intelligent” electricity management devices, unconventional transportation fuels, advanced nuclear power designs and cutting-edge energy conservation methods. We must remove burdensome government regulations, subsidies and other barriers that get in the way of adopting and exploiting such innovations.

Energy, Unleashed, Can Help All Americans Rise

Taken together, these policies will fully unleash the Energy Revolution, creating more jobs, higher wages, cheaper gas and cheaper electricity, while better protecting our interests abroad and our environment. This plan will help us quickly achieve, and sustain, 4% economic growth.

With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation – and with presidential leadership, we can make it happen.

But to achieve these policies, we have to change the way Washington works. And we have to change who we send there to lead. With North American resources and American ingenuity, we can finally achieve energy security for this nation – and with presidential leadership, we can make it happen in the near-term. If we do all of this, and if we do it right, we will make the United States of America an economic superpower like no other.

Health Care Plan

The Conservative Plan for 21st Century Health

The Conservative Plan for 21st Century Health

ObamaCare is a government takeover of more than one-sixth of the American economy, and it epitomizes why Americans are so fed up with Washington. To win on repeal, conservatives must unite  around a vision of health care for the future – one that enables transformational innovation. Governor Bush’s plan would repeal ObamaCare and accomplish three things:

1. Promote innovation
2. Lower costs
3. Return power to states

Here is how Governor Bush would repeal and replace ObamaCare:

1. Promote innovation in health care

Health care costs grow faster than any other sector of the economy and innovation lags. Why? Washington over-regulation in health care creates high barriers to entry, adds excessive costs, fosters excessive complexity and impedes innovation. Governor Bush will:

Modernize the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory morass and increase funding and accountability at the National Institutes of Health
Promote private sector leadership of health information technology adoption and enable better access to patient de-identified Medicare and Medicaid claims data
Establish a comprehensive review of regulatory barriers to health innovation
Washington over-regulation in health care creates high barriers to entry, adds excessive costs, fosters excessive complexity and impedes innovation.

2. Lower costs and enable portable, secure coverage for all Americans

Until health care is oriented around consumers, providers and innovation, Americans will not get better value and results out of the health care system. In addition, coverage options must reflect a modern, 21st century workforce where workers frequently switch jobs or start new businesses and need the security of portable coverage.

Until health care is oriented around consumers, providers and innovation, Americans will not get better value and results out of the health care system.

It is critical to have a well-functioning individual market side-by-side with a strong employer-sponsored coverage market. The employer health insurance market represents a strong and innovative coverage platform for 154 million Americans. To improve coverage, Governor Bush will:

Provide a tax credit for the purchase of affordable, portable health plans that protect Americans from high-cost medical events
Increase contribution limits and uses for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to help with out-of-pocket costs
Facilitate transparency on costs and outcomes
Cap the employer tax exclusion to lower insurance premiums
Allow employers to use financial incentives to encourage wellness programs
Enable small businesses to make tax-free contributions to their workers’ individual, portable health plans

3. Take health care control out of Washington and return it to states

States should have responsibility, freedom and accountability to make their individual insurance markets more competitive, enhance access to care and design solutions for vulnerable Americans. Instead of Washington standardization, this approach emphasizes transparent outcome standards. States will have streamlined, capped federal funding and be responsible for meeting transparent metrics to:

Make their insurance markets more competitive. This will include enabling access to affordable, catastrophic plans in their states; a continuous coverage guarantee for individuals with pre-existing conditions; access to affordable care and improved health outcomes in their state; lower health care cost growth, including medical liability reform; and a transition plan for the 17 million individuals entangled in ObamaCare.
Strengthen the health care safety net. To achieve this, states may use a number of strategies: individualized, community-based benefit designs; coordinated care for individuals with behavioral health conditions and the disabled; tailored care delivery to reflect the diversity of state populations; personalized care solutions for high-risk individuals with proven data analytics; work requirements for able-bodied individuals; premium assistance for individual and employer-provided coverage; and consolidated funding from various programs to better coordinate care.

Cybersecurity

READ MORE
The Internet has transformed everyday life for people, revolutionizing communications and how Americans interact with each other and the world.  The Internet’s impact on economic growth has likewise been profound.  U.S. manufacturers reported e-commerce shipments were $3.3 trillion in 2013.  According to one report, from 2004 to 2009, the Internet accounted for 15% of GDP growth.

Yet, for all of the Internet’s transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factor—cybersecurity.  If people have no confidence their information will remain safe online, they will—quite simply—be less willing to use the Internet, thereby jeopardizing future growth possibilities.

…for all of the Internet’s transformational power, its future rests in part on one critical factor—cybersecurity.

Unfortunately, a series of high-profile cybersecurity failures and the Obama administration’s feeble response to the growing threat have demonstrated real vulnerabilities in government and private systems, eroding public confidence in both the government and even the Internet itself.  In June, I published some thoughts on cybersecurity, and at many town halls across the country I hear concerns from Americans about this threat.

This is an issue that gravely needs presidential leadership.  Ultimately, we need Internet security, and a strong tech industry that can be leveraged to the public’s benefit, in order to achieve high, sustained economic growth that will benefit everyone.  Let’s not mince words: in order to achieve 4% growth and the 19 million jobs that come with it, we need a vibrant and secure Internet.  Here is my plan to achieve that, starting with tackling the cybersecurity challenge.

1. Place a Command Focus on Cybersecurity.

We need to recognize the reality that today we are under cyberattack and we are not keeping up with the threat.  We also need to identify clearly the mission for government and the private sector: to work together to ensure the security of the Internet.  The rapid expansion of information technology in the past several decades, coupled with both the open architecture of the Internet and poor cybersecurity practices, have contributed to a dramatic rise in cyberthreats to the nation.  Last year, 60% of all targeted attacks struck small and medium-sized organizations, which often have fewer resources to invest in cybersecurity.  In 2014, five out of every six large companies were targeted with spear-phishing attacks, a 40% increase over the previous year.  Attacks against small and medium-sized businesses increased 26% and 30%, respectively.  And these are just the attacks we know about.  Many penetrations go unnoticed or unreported by companies that are victims of these attacks.

Effective cybersecurity starts with all of us — individuals, businesses, and the government—recognizing the importance of Internet security and our responsibility to help ensure its robust defense.  Effective cybersecurity depends in large part on the protective measures one takes before a cyberattack.  If we do not make cybersecurity a priority, we will continue to see major breaches and damaging attacks.  Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.

Cybersecurity should be considered a critical element of our national defense and economic well-being.

2. Restore Accountability within the Federal Government.

The government should lead by example.  We need presidential leadership to get government to take the cybersecurity threat more seriously, fix the vulnerabilities of government systems, and hold government leaders accountable for the security of information entrusted to their care.  It is easy to give a speech about cybersecurity.  What we need is unwavering leadership and determined implementation, including a concerted effort to work with Congress.

The intrusion into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—the human resources department of the U.S. Government—illustrates the cultural failure of the Obama administration to take these threats seriously.  The OPM systems contain millions of personnel records—many of which included an intrusive and sensitive personnel questionnaire.  OPM officials knew this data was valuable, sensitive, and vulnerable, but failed to take basic steps to protect it.

We need to change the culture of government, which is impossible absent presidential leadership.  Leadership means not hiring political hacks or cronies for critical positions that involve cybersecurity.  It also means holding executive branch officials accountable for their failure to prioritize cybersecurity and protect the networks under their care.  The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.

The people who protect our systems are just as important as the technology itself.

The President also cannot allow cabinet secretaries and senior officials to violate rules and procedures meant to protect classified and national security-related government communications.  It should not be too much to ask government officials to abide by the laws and rules in place to safeguard our national security.  Secretary Hillary Clinton’s growing email scandal highlights reckless behavior by officials entrusted with some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets.

3. Increase U.S. Intelligence and Law Enforcement Cybersecurity Capabilities and Strengthen International Cooperation.

We need to preserve and enhance the capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community and law enforcement to identify, deter, and respond to cyberattacks as part of a national strategy to protect the country.  This starts by undoing the damage that sequestration has done to the Defense Department and Intelligence Community and restoring funding to them.  The National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the frontlines of defending the United States against cyberthreats.  We must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation also needs more resources to fight back against the onslaught of cybercrime.

In addition, we must reform a convoluted acquisition process that imposes years of delays and inefficiencies in procuring new cybersecurity systems.  The Defense committees of Congress are already working on acquisition reform—the President should work with these committees and others to ensure that a byzantine acquisition process is streamlined for cybersecurity defense technologies.  The government could build upon some of the lessons learned by Secretary Bob Gates’ efforts to reform parts of the inefficient and costly defense acquisition process.

The President should also prioritize cybersecurity in discussions and agreements with our allies and partners around the world.  No one country can solve the cybersecurity problem, which is a global challenge.  The need to protect sensitive systems from bad actors is a modern-day equivalent of securing the world’s oceans for freedom of navigation, and just as nations came together to protect the seas, they should do so to secure the Internet.  At the same time, the United States must retain a strong leadership position in Internet governance.  For example, we should maintain oversight of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which manages the Internet’s domain name system.

We must also hold to account those who are stealing our nation’s intellectual capital.  Efforts to expose, prosecute, and in some cases retaliate against these actors will raise the cost of conducting such attacks and increase deterrence of future attacks.  Such deterrence will be stronger if we work with partners to establish international rules of the road and get them to establish the legal framework necessary to prosecute cybercriminals.

4. Create Public-Private Partnerships to Improve Cybersecurity in the Public and Private Sectors.

The U.S. Government and businesses should work together as partners to improve cybersecurity in public and private sectors in a way that also respects citizens’ privacy.  Just as the government needs to pay more attention to cybersecurity, so too must the private sector.  The government must do its part in getting its own house in order and then enable, empower, and expect the private sector to do the same.  Some industries take this threat more seriously than others, and there are lessons to be learned from their experiences.

The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors.  And to be clear, this will not be achieved with finger pointing and talking down to industries that have struggled with security while looking the other way as our classified information is handed over to state-sponsored cyberterrorists.

The country needs a President with the experience and trust necessary to mobilize public and private resources to enhance cybersecurity in public and private sectors.

At a minimum, the government should redouble efforts to: (1) reduce legal and technical barriers to cybersecurity information sharing between the federal government and private sector, and (2) promote best practices for the private sector, including voluntary cybersecurity standards (e.g., through the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s ongoing work).

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to facilitate information sharing by, among other measures, providing liability protection to private-sector companies that share cyberthreat information with each other or with the government.  Unfortunately, the bill languishes in the Senate due to opposition from Senate Democrats.  The President should lean on these Democrats to allow this bill to come to the Senate floor for a vote.

5. Remove Barriers to Innovation in the Tech Industry.

As part of this national effort to improve cybersecurity, the government must not be an obstacle to innovation in the tech industry.  The government’s power to incentivize and empower must take precedence over its predilection to regulate and constrain.  Because cyberthreats are always evolving, effective cybersecurity requires continuous innovation, which a flourishing tech industry provides.

We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity.

We must remove regulatory barriers and red tape that prevent companies from developing new technologies, as well as encourage private and public research into cybersecurity.  For example, regulatory barriers continue to make it extremely complicated, costly, and time-consuming for small companies to raise capital through the securities markets.  The Securities and Exchange Commission should reassess existing regulations to further minimize the number and complexity of documents that must be filed before everyday Americans are able to invest in emerging companies.  It should also work to ensure rules are in place to enable the creation of liquid markets for securities offered by startups.  We need to transform immigration into an economically-driven system that retains and brings in highly-skilled immigrants.  Such a system would help create startups and increase innovation.  We must lower business taxes to encourage investment and hiring in the United States.

The Internet and innovation from the tech industry have enormous potential to help address public policy challenges.  For example, digital connections between power plants, transformers, substations, and transmission lines allow for better management of the electric grid.  With such networks, utilities are better able to anticipate, avoid, or respond to power outages.  Using technology we can create a secure online credential for veterans that verifies their military service.  Such a credential could allow instant access to medical records online, and help the private sector offer military/veteran discounts online.  However, without a secure Internet, these types of initiatives may never reach their full potential.  Our country, starting with the President and federal government, must recognize the cybersecurity challenge and dedicate itself to conquering it.

The Internet is one of the greatest innovations in history and has led to unrivaled opportunity and a great leveling of the playing field for all.  I will be a President who works to actually bring people together from both sides of the aisle, as well as the public and private domains, to better address the very real threats confronting this critical global resource.

Under President Obama and Congress, the military will be cut by over a trillion dollars. Tens of thousands of troops have been forced out of uniform and into a broken economy. Those who remain are using old equipment, experiencing lapses in training and have been asked to do more missions with fewer people and resources.

Our adversaries around the world have taken notice. Russia is on the march, China has quadrupled its military spending, Iran is backing terror groups throughout the Middle East, North Korea continues to make threats in the Pacific and ISIS has expanded its war beyond Syria, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan to Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt and even France.

Governor Bush has a four-point strategy to rebuild our military, restore American leadership, defend our nation and bring order back to the international system.

Governor Bush has a four-point strategy to rebuild our military, restore American leadership, defend our nation and bring order back to the international system. He recognizes that it is our Constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. And he knows that the American people just want to be safe to live their lives in peace.

1. Restore International Order & Promote International Stability

After the Second World War, the United States built a series of alliances in order to preserve peace and protect prosperity. That system of alliances is under growing stress. Governor Bush would reinvigorate America’s special role as world leader. He would increase our commitment to NATO to counter an insatiable Russia, including sending an Army Special Forces Group back to European Command. He would increase our presence, restore alliances and build new partnerships in Asia. He would stand up to Iranian aggression in the Middle East, defeat ISIS and restore stability to Iraq and Syria. Finally, Governor Bush would increase partner-building exercises with foreign militaries, to lessen the load on U.S. forces.

2. Rebuild the Military to Defend American Interests & Values

Governor Bush opposes the $1 trillion in defense cuts passed by President Obama and Congress. He has committed to rebuilding the military and restoring faith with our troops. Governor Bush would increase the size of the Army by 40,000 soldiers and the size of the Marine Corps by 4,000 Marines. He would increase the size of the Navy and increase Virginia-class submarine production. He would replace aircraft that is older than our pilots. Governor Bush believes that the best way to secure the peace is to be strong and ready for any national emergency.

3. Reform the Pentagon

While the military needs to be rebuilt, Governor Bush does not believe in giving the Pentagon a blank check. He will institute strong reforms there, fixes that treat the taxpayer dollar with more respect and that get our troops equipment they need in a timely manner. He will reduce DC bureaucrats to free up resources for more uniformed military. Governor Bush believes it is our sacred obligation to make certain our men and women in uniform have the best training, equipment and leadership in the world.

4. Defend the Homeland

The first and most sacred obligation of the U.S. Government is to provide for the common defense, an enumerated responsibility in the Constitution. Protecting our shores is the number one of priority of government. Governor Bush believes that this starts with securing our border. He also has laid out plans to improve our cyber security and protect critical infrastructure that links avenues of commerce, transportation and energy. With the threat of terrorism at an all-time high, Governor Bush has committed himself to keeping Americans safe.

Education
For primary and secondary education, the bedrock concept that has always guided us has been “local control.” Communities fund and manage public schools for the benefit of families and children in their neighborhoods.

More than most, I’m acutely aware of education being the ladder that can lead one out of poverty and into realizing the American Dream.

In recent years, there has been a troubling trend of the U.S. Department of Education increasingly trying to dictate how children are educated in our primary and secondary schools. This must stop and Common Core must be overturned.

Our education system must be run by involved parents and engaged teachers and principals. Any attempt by faceless federal bureaucrats to take over our local schools must be defeated.

Health care
We didn’t need the monstrosity of the $1.2 trillion Affordable Care Act. Even after it is fully implemented for 10 years, 23 million people still won’t have any health insurance.

We need to re-establish a strong and direct relationship between patients and their physicians. For instance, I strongly support Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) which empower families to make their own decisions about their medical treatment. HSAs will also drive down health care costs while protecting patient choice and freedom.

More freedom and less government in our health care system will mean lower costs, more access, and continued innovation.

Keeping faith in our society
The United States of America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. We can and should be proud of that fact. It served us well for almost 200 years.

However, we need to reverse the recent trend of secular progressives using activist, federal judges to drive faith out of our society. Anyone who wishes to practice their faith, for example by praying privately, can and should be able to do so. Equally, the rights of someone to abstain from private prayer should also be jealously protected.

The First Amendment enshrines our freedom to practice whatever faith we choose from any government intrusion. Our Founding Fathers never meant for the First Amendment to be used to drive prayer out of the public square.

Russia and Lessons Learned
Vladimir Putin’s Russia has become dangerously belligerent. It is actively destabilizing Ukraine, endangering Europe in the process and continuing to fuel destabilization in the Middle East. This newfound aggressiveness is a rising threat to the peace and security of the American people.

Russia
The United States must be resolute in the face of these Russian transgressions. We must lead our allies, both NATO and non-NATO alike, from a position of strength.

History has painfully taught us that letting dictators run amok and hoping for the best fails.

President Putin must come to learn that there will be grave and serious consequences when Russia engages in naked aggression against other sovereign nations and free peoples. All options should remain on the table when dealing with international bullies such as President Putin.

Protect the Second Amendment
The right of law-abiding citizens to own firearms is fundamental to our liberty.

Second Amendment
It was no accident that our Founding Fathers enshrined the right to own firearms as the 2nd element of the Bill of Rights, immediately after establishing our free speech rights. I cannot and will not support any efforts to weaken The 2nd Amendment.

The 2nd Amendment is a central pillar of our Constitution. Our Founding Fathers added it explicitly in order to protect freedom in the United States of America. It provides our citizens the right to protect themselves from threats foreign or domestic.

The current tax code now exceeds 74,000 pages in length. That is an abomination.

Tax reform
It is too long, too complex, too burdensome, and too riddled with tax shelters and loopholes that benefit only a few at the direct expense of the many.

We need wholesale tax reform.

And, we won’t get that from career politicians in Washington. They’re too deeply vested in the current system to deliver the kind of bold, fresh, new reforms that the American people are demanding.

We need a fairer, simpler, and more equitable tax system. Our tax form should be able to be completed in less than 15 minutes. This will enable us to end the IRS as we know it.

Criminal Justice
Governor Christie laid out a plan focused on keeping communities safe while helping non-violent offenders reclaim their lives

Camden As National Model For Community Policing

Effective law enforcement requires a police force that is engaged in their community and has the necessary resources and support. In Camden, New Jersey – long one of the most violent cities in America – Governor Christie joined a coalition of county and community leaders that brought about a fundamental restructuring of the city’s police force and a rethinking of their engagement with those they serve.
Police can build trust while also keep people safe through a focus on community outreach, putting officers right on the streets and investing in cutting edge crime-fighting technology.
In Camden, residents have begun to see the benefits of these types of reforms with a 22 Percent Overall Drop In Violent Crime and a 51 Percent Reduction In Homicides.

Restore Fairness And Common Sense To The Justice System

Focus on Treatment First Through Drug Courts: Governor Christie has championed the use of drug courts in the state of New Jersey, which allow first time, non-violent offenders, the opportunity to get the treatment they need rather than serving jail time. The Governor expanded mandatory drug court for first time non-violent drug offenders across the state, and is calling for the expansion drug courts to every state. Governor Christie is also calling for ending the current dysfunctional, ad-hoc approach for implementing drug courts being used on the federal level and as President, would make drug court mandatory in all 94 federal districts.

Common-Sense Bail Reform: It is fundamentally unfair that in some cases individuals charged with minor, non-violent offenses can be held in jail while awaiting trial simply because they cannot afford bail, while dangerous and violent offenders can be back out on the streets because they can.
Bail should be issued based on an assessment of risk, and judges should be able to deny release to those with violent records or who pose a threat to their communities.
Individuals who commit non-violent, minor offenses should have access to non-monetary bail options – giving them a chance to reclaim their lives.

Helping Ex-Offenders Reclaim Their Lives

One-Stop Reentry Services: Governor Christie is calling for an expansion of the one-stop model to help ex-offenders access critical services and support that creates stability and consistency. In New Jersey, a single physical location in each participating city was established to provide access to the services proven most critical to help ex-offenders move forward from addiction, find stability and re-enter their communities: Addiction Treatment, Housing & Employment Services.

Education and Job Training Opportunities for Inmates: Educational and training opportunities for inmates should be expanded so that upon release ex-offenders will have acquired the skills they need to find stable employment. Re-entering the workforce is a critical step for ex-offenders to reintegrate into their communities and lead productive lives.

Ban The Box: One of the biggest challenges facing ex-offenders as they seek to re-enter society is finding and maintaining stable employment. One key step we can
take to help these individuals find jobs is to require employers to first interview job applicants before asking if he or she has ever been convicted of a crime.

Entitlements
Governor Christie’s Plan To Reform Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid

Governor Christie has laid out a comprehensive series of proposals to reform entitlement spending, ensuring that America’s safety net will continue to exist for today’s seniors and future generations, while at the same time helping to reduce the explosion of national debt and demand for higher taxes that unrestrained growth of these entitlement programs will create.

SOCIAL SECURITY
Ensuring Economic Security For Future Generations of Seniors

Social Security exists so America’s seniors, after a lifetime of hard work, don’t fall into poverty. Governor Christie is proposing that Americans pay into this system throughout the course of their life knowing it will be there if they need it to support them, but if they are fortunate enough not to need it, they will have paid into a system that will continue to help Americans who need it most. This proposal will not impact current retirees, and will be phased-in gradually.

MEDICARE
Protecting Health Benefits For Today’s And Tomorrow’s Seniors

Medicare spending growth is placing an inescapable burden on future generations and failing to produce high-quality health care results for our seniors. In order to make these programs fiscally solvent for future generations and improve the kind of health care services and treatment those utilizing these programs receive, Governor Christie proposes keeping it simple - if you can afford to pay more for your health benefits you will and if you can’t, you won’t. Governor Christie proposes expanding the existing sliding scale for Medicare premiums for higher-income seniors.

MEDICAID
Empowering States To Focus On Better Services For The Individual

Governor Christie proposes giving each state a set amount of Medicaid funds indexed to the number of enrollees in Medicaid. Under such an arrangement, Medicaid would continue to provide more funding for states and low-income individuals when the economy is doing poorly and unemployment increases. By implementing a per capita cap system, all states will have increased freedom to tailor Medicaid programs to their citizens in the best-suited manner for their state.

DISABILITY INSURANCE
Refocusing Assistance To Put People Back to Work

Reforming Disability Insurance (DI) is an urgent challenge. The DI trust fund will become insolvent next year. The best way to save this program and ensure it has the necessary resources to assist those who need it is by focusing on ways to help those beneficiaries who can keep working to return to the workforce and encouraging rehabilitation in lieu of permanent disability. We should require applicants to first work directly with employers and rehabilitation specialists to create a plan and explore alternatives and accommodations that can be made to address their specific needs in their current workplace. We should also offer tax incentives that encourage employers to invest in prevention, accommodation and rehabilitation services for their workers as well as to provide short-term private disability insurance.

Foreign Policy
America’s Role In The World

A Stronger National Defense.
Keeping our military strong must be at the heart of any global agenda. A strong military doesn’t just help us to deal with the threats we face. It helps eliminate them before we even see them. We need to give our men and women in uniform the resources they need to get the job done. As President, Governor Christie will repeal the sequestration cuts and restore funding levels to what Secretary Gates proposed with modest increases in defense spending through the end of the decade.

We also need to build a new generation of weapon systems to protect our interests on every front – on the ground, on the seas, in the air or new frontiers even further out. We need to invest in unmanned aviation, directed energy weapons and space while continuing to be leaders in undersea warfare. When it comes to cyber warfare, we need to be ready not just to defend against threats, we need the offensive capabilities to deter our enemies – or strike back when necessary.

Strong, Reliable Intelligence.
Governor Christie has seen up close just how important the intelligence community is to defending our way of life. As U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, his office focused on fighting terrorism every day. When it comes to preparing for the threats over the horizon, strength and knowledge go hand in hand.
It is disgraceful the way there are folks in Washington who want American intelligence weaker and less informed just to drive their own personal political agendas. Protecting our homeland must be an uncompromising priority. We need to toughen our anti-terror and surveillance laws to give our intelligence services the legal mechanisms to do their job.

We need to invest in new technologies and infrastructure to support our signals intelligence, so that we can actually interpret all the data we’re gathering. At the same time, we need to strengthen our human intelligence capabilities in the parts of the world where they’re weakest. We can also do more to strengthen our cooperation and intelligence sharing with our neighbors, as well as our allies in Europe.

Stand With Our Allies And Stand Up To Our Adversaries.
It’s not just our strength and intelligence that defines us as a country; it’s our willingness to stand with those who share our values and interests. We became the leader of the free world because we also chose to become the arsenal of democracy. And when we make a commitment to stand with our allies, our word is our bond. Or at least it used to be. Right now, we have a government that doesn’t seem to care about all the blood and sweat and treasure that it took to build those alliances. Because we’ve broken our word.

Whoever is going to be our next Commander-in-Chief is going to make restoring America’s word a priority. We need to make it clear to our friends and allies that we stand with them in the cause of freedom, and against all the gathering threats.

Education
Governor Christie’s Education Reform Agenda
Governor Christie Is Committed To Delivering A High Quality Education To Every Child While Expanding Access To Affordable Higher Education

NEW JERSEY REFORMS A MODEL FOR THE NATION
Since taking office, Governor Christie acted on his commitment to ensure that every child in New Jersey has access to a high-quality education regardless of their zip code. The sweeping changes he enacted can and should be a model for reform for the nation.

Reform Tenure To Remove Teachers Who Are Failing Students While Rewarding Good Teachers For Performance: Tenure for teachers should be awarded and retained based on performance. In New Jersey, Governor Christie signed into law a sweeping, bipartisan overhaul of the oldest tenure law in the nation. Also, for the first time in New Jersey history, a new contract for teachers in Newark allows them to earn raises and be eligible for additional bonuses based in part on student performance.

Promote College Readiness: Focusing specifically on students from low income families, college readiness programs can enroll these students in transitional courses before they graduate high school to better prepare them for college. In New Jersey’s initial pilot of the College Readiness Now Program, 19 community colleges in partnership with over 60 high schools across the state successfully participated.

Provide School Choice For Those In Failing Districts: Students in struggling districts should have the option of attending a public school outside their district of residence without cost to their parents. Enrollment in New Jersey’s Inter-District School Choice Program increased more than 5-fold since the program was signed into law in 2010.

Expand Access To Charter Schools: Another way to expand the education options available for children trapped in school districts with the largest achievement gaps is to encourage the best charter school operators. The Christie Administration has increased the overall number of charter schools in New Jersey to 87, serving 37,500 students.

MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL
Governor Christie firmly believes that by ensuring students know the quality of the program they are investing in, giving them the flexibility and innovative tools to get the job done, while expanding access to tuition assistance, America can ensure that every young person can affordably develop the skills they need to compete in the modern economy.

Affordability & Student Aid: Governor Christie proposes to refocus federal student assistance for those at the bottom while expanding alternative funding such as income-share agreements in which students could agree to pay some percentage of their future income for a defined period of time in exchange for private financing as well as tax credits to pay for programs that pay down student debt in exchange for community service.

Transparency & Accountability: Students should be able to see cost itemization for tuition, so they can know what they’re really paying for. If colleges can break out those costs, they should also unbundle them – allowing students, to just pay for the education and not all the add-ons. Greater transparency will also allow schools to analyze and compare their operating costs with other similar institutions.

Innovation And Alternative Education Models: America should strive to give students lots of different ways to learn, and shouldn’t fear alternatives to traditional four-year public universities. ‘Stackable credentials’ would allow students to re-enroll at different colleges over time without losing credits so students have the flexibility to jump in and out of education as needed. We should also expand apprenticeships and training programs while linking employers with education institutions to offer a variety of paths for individuals to develop the skills the labor force needs.

Economy
1) PRO-GROWTH TAX REFORM
Governor Christie believes we need a tax system that lowers individual rates for every American while unleashing the nation’s growth potential. Governor Christie will reform the tax code by creating a flatter, fairer and simpler individual income tax system and keep returns simple by reducing deductions and giveaways.

Governor Christie will also lower the Corporate Tax Rate to a more competitive 25% which S&P has suggested could help create as many as 10 million jobs, and allow companies a one-time opportunity to repatriate over two trillion dollars of profits currently sitting overseas at a much lower tax rate which would unleash a wave of new capital investment.

2) GETTING REGULATION UNDER CONTROL
This era in which the Obama administration tries to accomplish its ideological goals through the regulatory state must end. Regulation should be used to implement actions explicitly authorized by statute. Further, the next president should review every rule and executive order published under this administration during the transition, so that on day one, the most egregious and unlawful ones can be revoked.

We should restore the principle that for any new regulatory change proposed that the benefits outweigh the costs. We should also impose a “Regulatory Zero” rule in which for each new rule that is imposed, one of equal cost must be sunsetted or removed. Additionally, we should impose a hard cap on what it can cost for employers to complying with all federal regulation.

3) A NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY
As Governor Christie stated in Mexico last fall, we are in the midst of a North American Energy Renaissance. The U.S. and its friendly neighbors and close trading partners Canada and Mexico – have a major opportunity to increase the competitiveness of our regional economy in the world, and to improve our strategic and security position at the same time.

The U.S needs to build the necessary infrastructure to get product to markets and ensure the smooth functioning of our energy markets, lift the ban on crude oil exports and allow markets to function as well as rationalize the country’s approach to regulation to make sure it is fair. We can also ensure the U.S can maximize its energy resources in an environmentally sound manner by developing greater technological capabilities.

4) CREATING INCENTIVES TO WORK
The critical measure of success for any growth plan is people going to work at jobs worth doing. Today, though, there are too many federal policies which discourage work. America must reduce the marginal cost to the employee of taking a job, and reduce the federally-imposed cost to an employer of hiring someone.

Governor Christie proposes eliminating the payroll tax for those above age 62, as well as for those newly entering the workforce, below age 25. This will encourage those nearing retirement to keep working should they want to, and make it easier for the young to enter the workforce. Both will be good for America. He will also repeal Obamacare’s 30-Hour Workweek mandate which has been a clear contributor to the massive shift from full time to part time employment under this president.

5) ENSURING THAT AMERICA IS THE HOME OF INNOVATION
America must remain the home of innovation in the world. This will require investing in research and development, focusing education on the needs of employers and increasing access to capital. In addition to investing in universities themselves through research, the U.S. must do a better job matching the skills students learn with the needs of employers.

America has for many years had the deepest, most liquid, most transparent capital markets in the world. Yet America is now losing its edge, in part due to the unintended consequences of regulation. Reform which makes it easier for young high growth companies to access the capital markets is essential. To further encourage private sector innovation, the R&D tax credit should be made permanent as part of broader tax reform.

Border Security and Immigration
Governor Christie supports securing the border and common-sense fixes to America’s immigration system.

1.) SECURING THE BORDER:
Governor Christie has called for securing the border with Mexico through:

A border wall where appropriate, specifically in urbanized areas
An increase in manpower, specifically embedding FBI, DEA and ATF agents with our border patrol to interdict guns and drugs being smuggled into the country
Advanced technology such as the use of drones and electronic surveillance to increase efficiency

2.) UNIVERSAL WORKPLACE ENFORCEMENT:
Most who enter the country illegally come here to work. Employers should not be exploiting cheap illegal labor and should be held accountable when they do. Every employer in the country should be using e-verify to check the work status of employees.

Fines for hiring illegal workers should be double the profit a business has made from that worker. This will remove the incentive to hire illegal workers.

3.) KEEP TRACK OF THOSE WHO ARE OVERSTAYING THEIR VISAS:
Around 40% of the illegal immigrants currently in the U.S. came into the country legally and simply overstayed their visas. We should be utilizing existing biometric technology to keep track of those who enter the country on a visa, so that that they can be returned home once their visas are expired.

4.) ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR SANCTUARY CITIES:
As president, Governor Christie will enforce all the laws as president, not just some. He will block federal funding for sanctuary cities who are choosing to ignore the law.

5.) BLOCK PRESIDENT OBAMA’S ILLEGAL EXECUTIVE AMNESTY:
Governor Christie joined the legal fight against President Obama’s Executive Amnesty, signing onto an amicus brief that successfully urged the Appeals Court to uphold the injunction.

Governor Christie condemned President Obama’s Executive Actions and failure to secure border that have “allowed people to believe that they could come here under any circumstances not under the law and be able to stay here.”

Healthcare for America's Veterans
Governor Christie is committed to our nation’s veterans and providing them with the healthcare they’ve been promised.

1.) ANYTIME, ANYWHERE CARE:
Governor Christie believes veterans should be able to receive their health care benefit from any medical institution. Private sector and nonprofit hospitals want to be engaged in veteran health care and they should be brought in to supplement treatment delivered from veterans’ hospitals.

2.) QUALIFIED LEADERSHIP AT THE VA:
As President, Christie would hire a qualified professional who has run a major healthcare system in this country to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The majority of the role of the VA has become that of a healthcare provider and therefore needs someone who knows how to meet the mission of providing adequate and timely care.

3.) 24/7 HOTLINE:
In New Jersey, Governor Christie’s administration established a 24 hours a day 7 days a week hotline manned by mental health professionals as well as veteran volunteers. Governor Christie supports creating a similar nationwide hotline to act as a resource for veterans experiencing mental health issues when they get home.

OUR STANDARD: THE CONSTITUTION


Ted Cruz has spent a lifetime fighting to defend the Constitution — our nation’s founding document and the supreme law of the land — which was crafted by our founding fathers to act as chains to bind the mischief of government and to protect the liberties endowed to us by our Creator.

Religious Liberty

Defended Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties against Obamacare’s contraception mandate.
Led the way on several cases including a U.S. Supreme Court case that preserved the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Successfully defended the words “under God” in the Texas Pledge of Allegiance and Texas schools’ moment of silence law in federal district court.
Galvanized national support for Houston pastors who had been subpoenaed by the City of Houston to provide the content of their sermons forcing the City to back down.
Supported the right of students to display banners containing religious content at school sporting events.
Successfully defended the constitutionality of the Texas Ten Commandments monument, winning a 5-4 landmark decision before the U.S. Supreme Court, setting an important national precedent for the right to display similar monuments.
Fought to help the Boy Scouts of America to reverse a district court ruling barring them from leasing a public park.
Second Amendment

Played a crucial role in preventing federal legislation to restrict the Second Amendment rights of Americans.
Authored legislation to strengthen the Second Amendment rights of Americans by allowing interstate firearms sales.
Led 31 states in District of Columbia v. Heller where the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a ban on firearms in a 5-4 landmark decision.
Honored by the National Rifle Association with a 2008 resolution for his leadership in the Heller case, which noted that his “efforts made this victory for the American people possible.”
Awarded the NRA’s 2010 Carter-Knight Freedom Fund, which “rewards exemplary activities in the support and protection of the right to Keep and Bear Arms” for his work in the Heller and McDonald cases.
Argued against unreasonable and burdensome gun restrictions before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Recognized by NRA executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre who observed, “Ted Cruz is one of our nation’s leading defenders of the Second Amendment. For over a decade, Ted has fought tirelessly to defend our constitutional right to keep and bear arms, and his leadership was absolutely critical to our major victories before the U.S. Supreme Court.”
U.S. Sovereignty

Fought and won a landmark ruling for U.S. sovereignty in Medellin v. Texas at the U.S. Supreme Court against 90 foreign nations and the President to ensure the supremacy of U.S. legal system against encroachment by international treaties and rulings of the “World Court.”
Cosponsored a resolution urging the president not to sign the UN Arms Treaty, which would have subordinated the Second Amendments rights of American citizens to global interests.
Government Overreach

Called for a special prosecutor to investigate the targeting of conservatives by the IRS.

STRONGER, SAFER AMERICA
army-2015

A safer, stronger America safeguards freedom at home and across the globe. That’s why Ted Cruz has fought tirelessly to defend our nation’s servicemen and women, to restore America’s leadership in the world, and to secure our border and streamline our legal immigration system.

Opposed the Obama Administration’s dangerous deal with Iran that would allow Iran to pursue nuclear weapons.
Spearheaded legislation passed unanimously by Congress and signed by the President to prevent known terrorists from entering the United States as ambassadors to the United Nations.
Successfully pressured the Obama Administration to lift its unprecedented FAA ban on flights to Israel after exposing the move as, in essence, an economic boycott of our strongest ally in the Middle East. The ban was lifted within 36 hours of the Senator’s actions
Championed the Expatriate Terrorist Act to prevent Americans who join ISIS from returning to the United States to commit acts of terror at home.
Introduced legislation passed by the Senate to provide rewards for information leading to the arrest of Hamas terrorists responsible for the murder of American and Israeli teenagers.
Led the charge on a bipartisan resolution passed by the Senate to condemn Hamas’ use of civilians as human shields.
Authored legislation to allow victims of the Fort Hood terrorist attack to be awarded the Purple Heart and appropriate benefits.
Joined Texas and 25 other states in a lawsuit to stop President Obama’s illegal executive amnesty.
Authored legislation to triple the size of the U.S. Border Patrol.
Authored legislation to streamline and simplify our legal immigration system by consolidating segmented visas, creating real and transparent caps, eliminating the diversity visa lottery, and treating all immigrants equally by eliminating the per-country caps.
Urged the strictest enforcement of laws punishing those with prior felony convictions who entered the country illegally in a U.S. Supreme Court Brief in Lopez v. Gonzales.
Authored legislation to ensure that members of our military deployed to combat the spread of Ebola are entitled to the same tax benefits as those serving in a combat zone.
Promoted the strengthening of existing law to prevent discrimination or retaliation against military service members who appropriately express their religious faith.
Represented more than 3 million veterans before the U.S. Supreme Court in Salazar v. Buono, defending the constitutionality of the Mojave Desert Veterans Memorial. Along with co-counsel Kelly Shackelford of the Liberty Institute, then-Solicitor General Cruz fought for The American Legion, The Veterans of Foreign Wars, The Military Order of the Purple Heart, and the American Ex-Prisoners of War. In April 2010, the Supreme Court handed down a 5-4 decision in favor of the veterans.
Defended the constitutionality of the federal Solomon Amendment, which requires universities receiving federal funds to grant U.S. military recruiters equal access to campuses, notwithstanding the universities’ opposition to the military’s policies concerning sexual orientation.
Authored legislation to close a loophole in the federal “Motor Voter” law that preempts states from enforcing requirements that would ensure those registered to vote are U.S. citizens.

LIFE, MARRIAGE & FAMILY


Without life, there is no liberty. And ensuring every child is born into a home with a loving family provides the best chance for that child to achieve anything. That is why Ted Cruz has been on the front lines defending life and standing up for marriage when it has come under assault from activist judges.

Led the charge on behalf of 13 states to successfully defend, before the U.S. Supreme Court, a federal law that bans one form of late-term abortion, the Partial Birth Abortion Act.
Advocated for an investigation into abortion practices in the U.S. to prevent the atrocities witnessed in Kermit Gosnell’s facility from ever happening again.
Joined 18 states in successfully defending the New Hampshire parental-notification law before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Successfully defended in federal court Texas’s Rider 8, which prohibits state funds for groups that provide abortions.
Fought for the right of states to define marriage, without intrusion by unelected federal judges, by drafting the State Marriage Defense Act.
Defended Texas’s marriage laws when a renegade state court attempted to grant a divorce to a same-sex couple who had obtained a civil union in Vermont.
Authored legislation and a constitutional amendment in the Senate to prevent federal courts from further interfering with any state’s Constitutionally-protected authority to define marriage.

The American Dream — the idea that anyone, through hard work and determination, can achieve anything — is under assault like never before. Obamacare, an overreaching federal government, and out of control spending threaten the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to create jobs and innovate. This has to stop and Ted Cruz has led the way to bring back jobs, growth, and opportunity to America.

Authored the Obamacare Repeal Act as his first piece legislation.
Led the fight to defund Obamacare — the largest regulatory challenge facing our nation which has resulted in killing jobs, cutting workers’ hours, and causing millions of Americans to lose their doctors or health care.
Authored legislation to end taxpayer dollars subsidizing corporate fat cats, including the Ex-Im Bank.
Opposed the Renewable Fuel Standard ethanol subsidy.
Co-sponsored the Enhancing Educational Opportunities for All Act to expand school choice and make a quality K-12 education more accessible and affordable to low-income parents and students.
Authored legislation to expedite liquefied natural gas to support jobs, economic growth, and to stand united alongside our friends and allies in the face of Russian aggression.
Led the fight against regulating the Internet as a public utility because it threatens the Internet as a haven for entrepreneurial freedom and unlimited opportunity.
Set an early, high standard for meaningful Republican opposition to increasing the debt ceiling.
Demanded a 60-vote threshold vote on a clean debt-ceiling increase in February 2013, when Republican leadership wanted to allow the Democrats to raise the limit with a simple majority vote.
Insisted on a commitment from Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that the debt ceiling would not be increased as part of a deal to pass the budget .
Introduced the American Energy Renaissance Act to spur economic growth by harnessing our nation’s energy resources and removing federal impediments to energy exploration, development and trade and empowering the private sector to create good-paying, American jobs.
Sued the federal government to strike down portions of the Medicare Prescription Drug program as an unconstitutional intrusion in the sovereign authority of the States.
Opposed the Obama Administration’s Interior Department’s moratorium on offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico.
Urged the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Congress from impeding commercial development of private property in a state for the protection of a toad in that state.

Secure Our Nation
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
We need a president who is prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One. Our nation faces grave threats at home and in every region of the globe. Radical Islam is on the rise, and authoritarian leaders in Russia and China perpetrate their aggressions with impunity. Our allies distrust us and our enemies have no reason to respect or fear us. We need a president who understands the complex threats we face, has a clear and coherent strategy for addressing them, and will restore strong American leadership as a stabilizing force that reduces the chaos and conflict that currently engulf so much of the world. As president, Lindsey Graham would ensure we have the capability, the capacity, and the will to preserve our security and our values at home and abroad.

Restore American Leadership
We must end the practice of capitulating to our adversaries, alienating our allies, and abandoning those who are confronting the naked aggressions of dictatorial regimes. The threats and chaos plaguing every corner of the globe demand comprehensive strategies, and the military might to back them up. Leading from behind or retreating into isolationism only allows global threats to grow and raises the costs in the long term of securing our nation. We need a return to presidential leadership on the world stage that ensures the protection of Americans.

Click Here to Learn More
Fully Fund and Support Our Military
Our ballooning national debt poses a serious threat to our national security, but failed attempts to address it by blindly and recklessly slashing military funding are equally dangerous. We must reverse President Obama’s disastrous military cuts that put our security and our troops at risk, and replace them with responsible, targeted cuts and meaningful reforms that reduce federal spending the smart way. Our military is the world's most elite fighting force, and we must maintain our global superiority while keeping faith with the men and women who serve in uniform.

Click Here to Learn More
Defeat Forces of Radical Islam
No other strain of terrorism today poses a greater threat to our homeland, our troops, or our interests around the globe. The forces of Radical Islam, such as ISIS, are bent on the destruction of our way of life. Under President Obama, they have been allowed to become large, rich, and entrenched. We need to make them small, poor, and on the run. This will require an expanded presence of 10,000 troops in the region as part of a well-defined strategy with partner nations. Only by taking the fight to the enemy will we ensure that this war is never fought in our homeland.

Click Here to Learn More
Prevent a Nuclear and Belligerent Iran
We must ensure – at all costs – that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon or has the ability to share nuclear weapon technology with violent extremists committed to killing Americans. Iran is the greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It has sworn to destroy the State of Israel, and it has spread violence and chaos throughout the entire region. If Iran were to obtain a nuclear weapon, a nuclear arms race would ensue in the Middle East that would pose a direct threat to the security of America and our allies.

Click Here to Learn More
Provide Unwavering Support for Israel
Israel is one of our staunchest allies and closest friends. It is also the only nation in the Middle East that shares our democratic values. We need a president who will promote, protect, and support our critical relationship. Our president must not view support for Israel as a burden, but as the bedrock of peace, stability, and security in the Middle East.

Secure Our Future
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
National security and economic security are inextricably linked. A strong, prosperous, growing economy enables our nation to project leadership worldwide and effectively address the range of security threats we face. By the same token, a strong national defense preserves our liberties and ensures that every American has the opportunity to achieve economic success and pursue a higher quality of life. These opportunities must extend to all Americans, not just to a privileged few. As president, Lindsey Graham would pursue the policies and provide the leadership to ensure a growing economy and middle class.

Restore Fiscal Discipline
Washington spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much. We need to enact smart cuts and implement meaningful, systemic reforms of the entitlement programs that constitute the vast majority of our looming fiscal crisis. We need to simplify our tax code and expand our tax base. Lindsey Graham will end the practice of pushing the hard choices off to future generations.

Click Here to Learn More
Reform Entitlements
Within just a few short years, our entitlement programs face bankruptcy and trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that will cause our already ballooning debt to skyrocket and cripple our economy. Fixing Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is the linchpin to balancing future budgets and ensuring solvency for future generations. To do so, they must be reformed and modernized so that our seniors are protected, our critically important safety net is preserved, and our long-term fiscal outlook is secured.

Click Here to Learn More
Achieve Energy Independence
America should run on American energy. We cannot afford to exclude any source of energy here at home, from shale to nuclear to clean coal to renewables. We must build the Keystone pipeline and increase oil and gas exploration in the U.S., and do so in a way that protects the air we breathe and the water we drink. This is a vitally important matter of economic security and job creation, but it also has significant implications for national security. Every new domestic energy source we utilize reduces our dependence on oil from rogue regimes.

Click Here to Learn More
Ease Tax and Regulatory Burdens
Families and businesses should no longer suffer the consequences of a complex, burdensome tax and regulatory regime that stifles growth and innovation, and prevents Americans from reaping the full benefits of their hard work. Making our tax code simpler and fairer will unleash the economic power of American ingenuity and restore opportunity for working families at every rung of the economic ladder.

Click Here to Learn More
Secure the Border and Fix Illegal Immigration
The flow of illegal immigration across our borders is a threat to both our economic and national security. We need a comprehensive plan to address this problem and it starts with securing our border. On the economic front, American workers, who are forced to pay taxes, are being cheated by illegal immigrants paid under the table. We should require illegal immigrants to register with the government to ensure they are paying taxes, learning English, undergoing background checks, and paying restitution for entering our nation illegally. Then, after living under our laws and our rules, we should require they wait for citizenship behind legal immigrants already in line. Finally, after going through this lengthy process -- including paying fines, paying taxes, learning English, and passing an American civics and assimilation exam -- which should take a decade or longer, an illegal immigrant could become a citizen, rather than remaining in the shadows and outside the arm of the law. Most important, we need presidential leadership on this issue to build consensus and craft solutions through constitutional means, not executive fiat.

Click Here to Learn More
Repeal and Replace Obamacare
Obama's radical policy to remake our healthcare system has left countless Americans shut out of their preferred plans with their preferred doctors, paying higher premiums and deductibles, and working fewer hours. We need to repeal and replace this deeply flawed program with real reforms that will improve access to quality, affordable care for all Americans.

Click Here to Learn More
Making Washington Work
The president represents our entire country, not just a single party. We need a leader who is firmly grounded in conservative principles. But our president must also recognize we have two parties, as well as a large number of those who belong to neither. Getting the important work done requires reaching out to Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. True leadership is the ability to bring Americans of all stripes together to forge a path forward that makes our nation stronger, more secure, and more prosperous.

Secure Our Values
Prepared to be Commander in Chief on Day One
America was built upon the fundamental notions that life and liberty are sacred and inalienable rights. Our limited, constitutional government was designed to protect these rights. We need a president who will uphold the sanctity of life, defend our right to keep and bear arms, and preserve the liberties and traditional values upon which this country was founded. As president, Lindsey Graham will vigorously defend these core values and ensure that America remains a shining city on a hill.

Protect the Sanctity of Life
There is no part of society more vulnerable and in need of our protection than the unborn. The inalienable right to life of every innocent human being is an essential element of a civil society. From authoring the Unborn Victims of Violence Act to co-sponsoring the Partial Birth Abortion ban, Lindsey Graham has a long history of leadership on pro-life legislation. The Graham 20-Week Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is the most important federal pro-life effort today. This essential legislation, authored and sponsored by Lindsey Graham, bans abortions at 20 weeks, when a fetus is capable of feeling pain. It represents a critical step toward reaffirming the sanctity of life and preserving the basic constitutional rights of the most vulnerable. We need a president who always has, and always will, fight for the rights of the unborn.

Preserve Traditional Marriage and Protect Religious Freedom
Strong families are the core of a strong America. Traditional marriage as a union between a man and a woman has been the bedrock of human civilization for thousands of years. It is an institution that benefits society in a way that no other relationship can. We must tirelessly support families, traditional values, and religious freedom against efforts to diminish and undermine them. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that state bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional, making the need to protect the right of every American to freely exercise sincerely held religious beliefs all the more urgent. We need a president who will staunchly defend these liberties and devote the necessary federal resources to ensure that no one's First Amendment right to freedom of religion is infringed.

Click Here to Learn More
Protect Religious Freedom Globally
People of faith are under attack around the globe. Christians, Jews, and Muslims are being subjected to barbaric acts by radical Islamic terrorists in the Middle East and North Africa, while others face persecution in China, Pakistan, Sudan, and beyond. America must lead the charge in defending religious freedom and protecting people of faith from violent persecution throughout the world.

Defend Second Amendment Rights
As a lifelong gun owner, Lindsey Graham understands the importance of protecting the Second Amendment. The right to keep and bear arms is one of our sacred constitutional freedoms. We need a president who will vigilantly defend the rights of law-abiding citizens against the constant attacks of those who want to infringe on the Second Amendment and flagrantly disregard our constitutional freedoms.

Uphold Conservative Values in Education
Education is best handled by parents, teachers, and local communities, not Washington bureaucrats. The U.S. Department of Education has grown too large, and its bureaucratic reach goes far beyond its mission. Any coercive efforts by Washington to impose Common Core standards on state and local school districts must be resisted. Parental rights in education are of the utmost importance. Those who choose to seek a better school or to homeschool their children must be allowed to make choices that are best for their families.

Taxes & Spending

As Governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes almost 100 times, balanced the budget every year, and left Arkansas with an almost $1 billion surplus.



As Governor, Mike Huckabee:

  The first Governor of Arkansas to pass a broad-based tax cut in the history of the state.


  Doubled the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, doubled the childcare tax credit, and eliminated the marriage penalty.


  Eliminated the capital gains tax on the sale of a home.


  Eliminated the state income tax for families below the poverty line.


  Reduced the capital gains tax for businesses and individuals.


  Indexed the income tax to protect people from paying higher taxes because of "bracket creep."


  Left the state with almost a $1 billion surplus - a state record.


  Urged that the surplus should go back to the taxpayers in the form of a rebate or tax cut.


Economy & Wages

  Average family income increased by over 50%.


  Cut welfare rolls by almost 50%.


Law And Order

Law and order has always been one of my top priorities. The two people in this country he values the most are soldiers and police officers, because they are the only thing standing between our freedom and total anarchy.



My record on law and order as Governor includes::

  A 20% drop in murders.


  Carrying out 16 executions.


  Denying over 85% of all commutation requests.


  Cracking down on methamphetamine labs, child abuse, and domestic battery.


Education

I believe education is a family function - not a federal function. I have a strong record of supporting local control over education, starting in the household.



As Governor, I:

  Protected the right of parents to home school their children.


  Appointed a former home schooling parent to the State Board of Education.


  Signed a much improved charter school bill, resulting in the creation of Arkansas' first ever charter schools.


  Issued a Home School Day proclamation.


Values

You will not find a stronger champion of the sanctity of human life, traditional marriage, and the family values we hold dear.



As Governor, I:

  Fought for life, family, marriage and religious liberty.


  Passed a ban on partial-birth abortion.


  Signed a statewide marriage protection bill into law.


  Passed a law requiring internet filters in public schools.

Abolishing the IRS — FairTax

Americans spend upwards of $1 trillion each year complying with our 75,000-page tax code that is so confusing and complex, our government cannot explain it.

Instead of tinkering with the tax code, we need a tax revolution that helps every hard-working American and eliminates the IRS once and for all.

Abolish the IRS. Help me pass the Fair Tax.

We need the FairTax.

  The FairTax brings trillions of dollars in offshore investment and manufacturing back to the United States - creating millions of good jobs for American workers.


  The FairTax is the only plan that lowers everyone's tax rates, untaxes the poor, broadens the tax base, and helps protect Social Security and Medicare.


  The FairTax is the only plan that guarantees criminals, illegal immigrants, and all who operate in the underground economy pay their fair share - not just hard working Americans who play by the rules.


  The FairTax is the only plan that guarantees Washington bureaucrats don't have access to your personal financial information.


I cut taxes nearly 100 times as governor, including the first broad-based tax cut in the history of my state. It’s time for Washington to wake-up because America’s tax system is badly broken and beyond repair.

Israel — Our Friend & Ally

In a world of uncertainty, evil, and moral insanity, Israel is a shining light of moral clarity. The enemies of Israel are the enemies of America.

Sadly, this Administration spends more time berating Israel for building houses in the lands given to Abraham than telling the Iranians to stop building bombs pointed at us.



As President, I will:

  Stand with the Jewish people in our shared fight against
Radical Islam.


  Support a unified Jerusalem.


  Confront and stop Iran—this Administration’s willingness to trust Iran and undermine Israel is unprecedented and wrong.


  Support Israel in the fight for peace, religious freedom, and human rights.

America’s Heroes — Our Veterans

My first act as President will be to end the national disgrace of failing to properly care for veterans who sacrificed so greatly for our country.

America’s soldiers deserve first-class treatment and top-quality care — anything less is unfair, unacceptable, and simply un-American.



As President, I will:

  Fix the VA and give our heroes greater choices. We must hold VA hospital officials and government bureaucrats accountable.


  Solve the disability claims crisis and inexcusable wait times.


  Empower our veterans with permanent careers, purpose, and a growing economy — not temporary programs or government gimmicks.


  Fight for mental health awareness, treatment, and suicide prevention.


Priorities matter — our nation must make sure the first fruits of our treasury go to those serving in uniform.

Energy Independence

We shouldn’t import from our enemies basic necessities we can produce ourselves. A country that can’t feed itself, fuel itself, or fight for itself can never truly be free.

Let’s put American workers back to work, build our economy, and restore our nation’s security with American-made, homegrown energy.

I believe in self-reliance. We have hundreds of years of available energy underneath our feet and all around us. We can power ourselves out of this deep economic hole with common sense energy independence.

Partisan politics has kept us from Arctic exploration, energy opportunities along the Outer Continental Shelf, building the Keystone pipeline, and new sources of natural gas. Wind, solar, and renewable energy have great potential, occur naturally, and flow from inexhaustible sources.

We should explore and exploit all forms of domestically produced energy — oil, gas, wind, solar, bio-fuels, hydro-electric, nuclear, coal — anything and everything.

Washington’s Reckless Spending

The Obama Administration has saddled Americans with trillions and trillions in new government debt. Enough is enough.



As President, I will:

  Reject the failed Obama-Clinton policies that punish working families and encourage government dependency.


  Secure the border & end illegal immigration.


  Repeal & replace ObamaCare.


As Governor, I could not simply print money — I balanced the budget ten years in a row. I will take that experience to the White House and rein-in Washington’s reckless, runaway spending.

Protecting America From Enemies & Evil

From Christian decapitations to radical Islamist victory marches, crisis and chaos is erupting across the world. The Obama Administration lacks moral clarity and common sense.

We must:

  Rebuild America’s military superiority. The best way to avoid conflict is to build a lethal fighting force so strong and powerful that no one would dare mess with us.


  Restore our role as leader of the Free World. Our enemies no longer fear us and our allies no longer trust or respect us.


  Reject Obama’s crisis-management approach to the world. We need a President who will accept responsibility and lead.


  As President, I will lead with moral clarity in a dangerous world. Moral clarity is the foundation to our economic and military strength.


There is a difference between right and wrong, good and evil. I will keep all options on the table in order to defeat the evil forces of Radical Islam.

No summer vacation for Congress until the Iran deal is killed. Co-Sign Mike's letter today.

Fighting for Seniors, Social Security & Medicare

Social Security and Medicare are not voluntary programs. They are based on involuntary confiscation from every paycheck with the promise that people will receive benefits when they retire. The government does enough lying and stealing. It shouldn’t play people for chumps by taking money from workers for 50 years and then fail to uphold its promise. These are earned benefits.



  We must repeal and replace Obamacare, which robbed $700 billion from Medicare.


  Robbing people of the benefits they have contributed is not a solution — it’s an escape.


  20 percent of Medicare spending is waste, fraud and abuse. We must protect Medicare and prosecute fraud.


  We must grow the economy and ensure everyone is paying into the system.


As President, I will protect Social Security and Medicare. I will kill anything that poses a threat to the promises we have made to America’s seniors.

Repealing ObamaCare — REAL Health Care Reform

ObamaCare is a $2.2 trillion disaster that dumps millions of people into a broken, expensive system and does nothing to fix the basic problems everyday Americans face.



  We must tackle out-of-control costs.


  ObamaCare raided $700 billion from Medicare. This is not reform — it’s theft.


  We must reject government dependency.


  We need solutions and choices — not government mandates and new taxes.


  We must address pre-existing conditions with common sense.


As a governor, I know these issues first hand. Our system of “sick care” is upside down. Doctors, hospitals and drug companies get paid for treating people who are sick — not keeping people healthy or preventing illnesses. So many Americans cannot afford to get sick, while others take advantage of a system that isn’t fair.

ObamaCare simply doubles down on this backwards, broken, flawed and failing system. We need honesty, leadership and real reform. As President, I will repeal ObamaCare and fight for real health care reform.

Common Sense Education

When it comes to education, the Obama Administration is lost at sea. We must shift power back to state and local governments. In my ten years as governor, I fought for parents, students and local control.



  Washington bureaucrats and big-government central planners are out-of-control.


  Education is a family function — not a federal function.


  Education decisions are best made by the most local government — Moms and Dads.


I believe we must demand results, accountability and success for every child in every classroom. I oppose watering down our education standards or automatically promoting every student.

I also oppose Common Core and believe we should abolish the federal department of education. We must kill Common Core and restore common sense.

The rising cost of college also threatens middle class families, students and the American dream. For too many, college is where students discover mountains of debt — but not a lifelong career. We must tackle the establishment and reform our colleges and universities so they make sense for the jobs of tomorrow.

Immigration & Border Security

America has an immigration crisis on its hands, and it’s time for the federal government to do its job. Without a secure border, nothing matters.

We have drug cartels running reckless on our southern border, and the Washington establishment wants to reward illegal immigrants with amnesty and citizenship.

As President, I will:

  Reject President Obama's unconstitutional executive orders.


  Oppose amnesty.


  Secure the border now.
If you reward people who play outside the rules and punish people who live within the rules, pretty soon nobody is going to play by the rules. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.

  Endorse my plan to end illegal immigration.

Firearms, Freedom & the Second Amendment

The Second Amendment is the last line of defense against tyranny and must be protected.

I was the first governor in America to have a concealed handgun license, and I’m a lifetime member of the NRA.

As President, I will:

  Defend the 2nd Amendment

  Oppose new gun control laws

  Protect the rights of gun owners from Big Government

  Oppose new gun restrictions, registrations, regulations & mandates

This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because some people drive drunk.

I’m a lifelong deer, duck, turkey, and pheasant hunter. But the Second Amendment isn’t about hunting — it’s about preserving all the rights we possess as American citizens. Washington needs to understand this basic truth.


I, Mike Huckabee, pledge allegiance to God, the Constitution, and the citizens of the United States:
  As President I will defend our 2nd Amendment rights and oppose gun control legislation.

Life, Marriage & Family — Our Values

We’ve abandoned the building blocks of civilization. Life, marriage and family issues aren’t bargaining chips or political considerations. They are moral issues.

I will never apologize for my faith, my convictions or my values. Period.

Life begins at conception. This isn’t just a Biblical view — it’s affirmed by modern science and every unique human DNA schedule, which is present at conception.

As Governor, I promoted and signed a fetal protection act. I imposed a ban on partial birth abortion, established waiting periods, created parental notification requirements, and passed a bill so mothers who brought a newborn to a hospital or fire station would not be prosecuted for child abandonment.

I may stand alone, but I am absolutely faithful to the issue of marriage. Not because it’s politically expedient, but because it’s the Biblical position, the historical position and the right position. We must defend, protect and preserve traditional marriage.

Rand Paul on Spending and Debt
As I travel across the country and speak to my constituents, I have found that their top concern is our national debt.

We are currently spending roughly $7 million per minute and this reckless habit has gone on for way too long.  We currently face a debt of over $18 trillion. This is unsustainable. The fiscal crisis that faces our nation must be taken seriously and immediately addressed.

As President of the United States, I will work to balance our budget and only spend what comes in.  We must cut spending in all areas, particularly areas that are better run by state and local governments.

In 46 states across the nation, a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) has been enacted in their state constitutions. I have long been a proponent of adopting the same principle for the Federal Government. As President, I will work to authorize common sense solutions that will solve our nation's fiscal crisis.

Rand Paul has been a leader in the fight to stop illegal NSA spying on American citizens

Today, the United States government engages in the bulk collection of personal data from every American with a cell phone. The founding fathers would be ashamed if they could see the massive growth of government that has taken place at the expense of our constitutional liberties.

I believe that every American has a constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy which must be protected. Simply put, the phone records of law-abiding Americans are none of the government's business!

If the government has probable cause that an individual is a criminal or suspected terrorist, then they must first go to a judge and obtain a warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Verizon, Mr. Sprint, and Mr. AT&T are not individuals and "general warrants" which authorize this dragnet surveillance on millions of Americans violate the very intent of the Fourth Amendment. Simply owning a cell-phone does not mean you forfeit your constitutional rights. From your phone records, the government can discern the most intimate details of your life--whether you smoke, whether you gamble, what books you read, what magazines you read, whether you see a psychiatrist, or what medications you take. This domestic NSA spying is simply not acceptable in a free society.

As President of the United States, I will immediately end the NSA's illegal bulk data collection and domestic spying programs and protect the Fourth Amendment rights of all Americans. We must remember that our rights are unlimited, unenumerated, and given to us by God. Your rights are who you are, your rights are what you are, your rights are in your DNA – and the government can get over it.

Rand Paul Supports Term Limits and Government Reform

We have all seen the consequence of long-term incumbencies. Career politicians seem to care more about their career than what is best for their country. We have seen politicians grow more and more out-of-touch with each successive term.

It is time to put an end to the profession of "career politician," and impose limits on how many times a member is allowed to seek re-election. As a Senator, I introduced legislation that would limit the amount of time a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate may serve.

As President, I will continue to support term limits in the hopes of ensuring that your elected officials act in direct representation of you and your needs.

Rand Paul's Tax Plan Would Blow Up The Tax Code And Start Over

Some of my fellow Republican candidates for the presidency have proposed plans to fix the tax system. These proposals are a step in the right direction, but the tax code has grown so corrupt, complicated, intrusive and antigrowth that I’ve concluded the system isn’t fixable.

So I am announcing an over $2 trillion tax cut that would repeal the entire IRS tax code—more than 70,000 pages—and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5% on individuals and businesses. I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this “The Fair and Flat Tax.”

President Obama talks about “middle-class economics,” but his redistribution policies have led to rising income inequality and negative income gains for families. Here’s what I propose for the middle class: The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15% over 10 years.

Here’s why we have to start over with the tax code. From 2001 until 2010, there were at least 4,430 changes to tax laws—an average of one “fix” a day—always promising more fairness, more simplicity or more growth stimulants. And every year the Internal Revenue Code grows absurdly more incomprehensible, as if it were designed as a jobs program for accountants, IRS agents and tax attorneys.

Polls show that “fairness” is a top goal for Americans in our tax system. I envision a traditionally All-American solution: Everyone plays by the same rules. This means no one of privilege, wealth or with an arsenal of lobbyists can game the system to pay a lower rate than working Americans.

Most important, a smart tax system must turbocharge the economy and pull America out of the slow-growth rut of the past decade. We are already at least $2 trillion behind where we should be with a normal recovery; the growth gap widens every month. Even Mr. Obama’s economic advisers tell him that the U.S. corporate tax code, which has the highest rates in the world (35%), is an economic drag. When an iconic American company like Burger King wants to renounce its citizenship for Canada because that country’s tax rates are so much lower, there’s a fundamental problem.

Another increasingly obvious danger of our current tax code is the empowerment of a rogue agency, the IRS, to examine the most private financial and lifestyle information of every American citizen. We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obama’s policies. A convoluted tax code enables these corrupt tactics.

My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundation’s Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest. All deductions except for a mortgage and charities would be eliminated. The first $50,000 of income for a family of four would not be taxed. For low-income working families, the plan would retain the earned-income tax credit.

I would also apply this uniform 14.5% business-activity tax on all companies—down from as high as nearly 40% for small businesses and 35% for corporations. This tax would be levied on revenues minus allowable expenses, such as the purchase of parts, computers and office equipment. All capital purchases would be immediately expensed, ending complicated depreciation schedules.

The immediate question everyone asks is: Won’t this 14.5% tax plan blow a massive hole in the budget deficit? As a senator, I have proposed balanced budgets and I pledge to balance the budget as president.

Here’s why this plan would balance the budget: We asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government. The analysis is positive news: The plan is an economic steroid injection. Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10%, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.

And because the best way to balance the budget and pay down government debt is to put Americans back to work, my plan would actually reduce the national debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with my package of spending cuts.

The left will argue that the plan is a tax cut for the wealthy. But most of the loopholes in the tax code were designed by the rich and politically connected. Though the rich will pay a lower rate along with everyone else, they won’t have special provisions to avoid paying lower than 14.5%.

The challenge to this plan will be to overcome special-interest groups in Washington who will muster all of their political muscle to save corporate welfare. That’s what happened to my friend Steve Forbes when he ran for president in 1996 on the idea of the flat tax. Though the flat tax was surprisingly popular with voters for its simplicity and its capacity to boost the economy, crony capitalists and lobbyists exploded his noble crusade.

Today, the American people see the rot in the system that is degrading our economy day after day and want it to end. That is exactly what the Fair and Flat Tax will do through a plan that’s the boldest restoration of fairness to American taxpayers in over a century.

Rand Paul Supports an Audit of the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve was created by Congress and is supposed to be overseen by Congress. The Fed is now in every nook and cranny of banking with unprecedented regulatory powers and no Congressional oversight. I believe the Fed should be audited and the regulatory power should be placed back under the control of Congress.

A complete and thorough audit of the Fed will finally allow the American people to know exactly how their money is being spent by Washington. For too long, the Fed has been operating under a cloak of secrecy. The American people have a right to know what the Federal Reserve is doing with our nation's money supply.

I will continue my fight to audit the Fed and restore transparency and fiscal sanity to our nation’s checkbook.

Rand Paul Supports a Strong National Defense

I believe that one of the primary functions of the Federal Government is national security. As a Senator, one of the most important votes I could make is on a declaration of war. As Commander-in-Chief, the importance of this decision would not be overlooked. If the military action is justified and there is no other course of action, I would follow the Constitution and seek Congressional approval before sending our brave men and women into harm's way.

The Founding Fathers understood the seriousness of war and thus included in our Constitution a provision stating that only Congress can declare war.  We must maintain this important check and balance and the decision to wage war should not be taken lightly.

I believe in Ronald Reagan’s “Peace through Strength.” I will continue to stand with Israel and our allies abroad, and I vow to explore all diplomatic options before sending our armed forces into battle. Finally, if and when we choose to fight, we will empower our military to fight to win.

Rand Paul Supports Free-Market Principles in Health Care and the Repeal of Obamacare

I was not a member of the United States Senate during the 111th Congress, but if I had been I would have voted against Obamacare. As your President, one of my first acts would be to repeal the abomination that is Obamacare.

As a doctor, I have had firsthand experience with the immense problems facing health care in the United States. Prior to the implementation of Obamacare, our health care system was over-regulated and in need of serious market reforms—but Obamacare is not the answer.

Government interventions in health care have driven up the cost of coverage and decreased competition within the market. More—not less—freedom to choose and innovate will make sure our health care system remains the best in the world.


As your President, I will ensure that real free-market principles are applied to the American health care system so that it is responsive to patients, families, and doctors, rather than government bureaucracy.

Rand Paul Supports New Energy Development, Cutting Red Tape, and Lowering Energy Costs for Consumers

Washington's bureaucratic regulations, corporate subsidies, and excessive taxation have made it unnecessarily difficult for energy developers to take advantage of new and innovative forms of cheap and clean energy.

Cutting the red tape and encouraging energy freedom, new technologies, and discoveries will be a priority in my administration. Like all other sectors of the economy, allowing businesses to compete in a free market will not only produce the most efficient forms of energy, but will also pass along the cost savings to the consumer.

I support the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and I have repeatedly voted to allow this project to proceed.

The Obama Administration's hostile approach to traditional energy development must be stopped. As your President, I will be committed to developing a sound, innovative, and safe energy policy.

Rand Paul Opposes Amnesty and Believes We Must Secure The Border While Encouraging Legal Immigration

I do not support amnesty, but rather I support a legal immigration process. I recognize that our country has been enriched by those who seek the American Dream and have a desire for a better life. However, millions of illegal immigrants are crossing our border without our knowledge, and this threatens our national security.

As President, I would secure our border immediately. Before issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process, we must first ensure that our border is secure.

While serving in the Senate, I introduced legislation that would make immigration reform conditional on Congress voting on whether the border is secure, requiring completion of a border fence in five years and a protection against the federal government establishing a national identification card system for citizens.

My "Trust but Verify" amendment requires Congress to write and enforce a border security blueprint rather than relying on bureaucracies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, to come up with a plan. The amendment also would provide new national security safeguards to track the holders of student visas and those provided asylum and refugee status.

In order to protect our nation and reform the immigration process, we must know who is and is not entering our country by first securing our border.

As President, I would implement my “Trust but Verify” plan and put pressure on the Department of Homeland Security to finally follow through on the broken promise of a secure border and an effective visa tracking system.

Rand Paul Supports Cutting Regulations and Allowing Businesses to Flourish

Counteracting excessively burdensome government regulations has become a centerpiece of my tenure in Washington. All my actions seek to find a balance between environmental, safety and health protection, without compromising the ability of family businesses to flourish.

Unelected bureaucrats should not have the power to enact regulations that affect the lives of everyday Americans. It is important that those citizens are made aware of how these regulations come to be. Whether it’s Obamacare or EPA regulations, cutting red tape and opening the regulatory process to scrutiny is an important step in holding government accountable to all Americans.

In the Senate, I proudly introduced the Regulations from the Executive Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act. This legislation is designed to increase accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process.

As President, I will cut regulations and take power away from unelected bureaucrats who are trampling our freedom and rights. I will place common sense and reasonable limitations on a bureaucracy that seeks to target well-intentioned businesses with burdensome regulations.

Rand Paul Supports Reform to the Criminal Justice System

Since taking office, I have found that one of the biggest impediments to finding a job is a criminal record. Upon examining our nation’s criminal justice system, I found that the system is in desperate need of reform.

I have called for comprehensive reform measures to fix America’s broken criminal justice system, ease the burden on taxpayers, and break the cycle of incarceration for non-violent ex-offenders.

In his 1967 address to Stanford University, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke of two Americas. He described them as, "two starkly different American experiences that exist side by side." In one America, people experienced "the opportunity of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in all its dimensions." In the other America, people experienced a "daily ugliness" that dashes hope and leaves only "the fatigue of despair."

Although I was born into the America that experiences and believes in opportunity, my trips to Ferguson, Detroit, Atlanta, and Chicago have revealed that there is an undercurrent of unease brought forth by our unjust criminal justice system.

I have worked across the aisle to reform the system with various pieces of legislation including:

The REDEEM Act: Creates a judicial process for adults to seal non-violent criminal records on the federal level. It also creates an automatic expungement of records for non-violent juveniles under the age of 15. It mandates the FBI to update their criminal background check system to ensure that employers receive accurate information. States are incentivized to have substantially similar legislation on the state level or risk losing appropriations for law enforcement agencies.

Justice Safety Valve Act: Judges can depart from mandatory minimum sentencing laws if they find that it is in the best interests of justice to do so. This would increase judicial discretion and allow judges to make individualized determinations about the proper punishment for defendants.

Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act: If passed, this would restore the voting rights of every non-violent felon in the country. Non-violent felons would be able to vote in federal elections only and states that do not change their laws to reflect this would not receive federal prison funds.

RESET Act: This bill re-classifies simple possession of controlled substances – very small amounts – as a misdemeanor rather than a low-level felony. It also eliminates the crack-cocaine disparity.

FAIR Act: This bill ensures that the federal government would have to prove by clear and convincing evidence that seized property was being used for illegal purposes before it’s forfeited. Forfeited assets would be placed in the Treasury’s General Fund instead of the DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture Fund. This shift would remove the profit incentive police officers currently have to seize and forfeit property. The bill would also protect the property rights of citizens by eliminating the ability of state law enforcement to circumvent state asset forfeiture laws and use more lenient federal standards instead.

As President, I will continue to work across the aisle to reform our criminal justice system in the hopes of tearing down the wall between the two Americas, and giving everyone a shot at the American Dream.

Rand Paul Supports Our Civil Liberties and Constitutional Rights

The usurpation of power by our current Federal Government would make our Founding Fathers roll over in their graves.  Our country was founded on principles that meant to expand personal liberties and limit the role of government. I believe we must return to these principles.

I have made it my priority to reassert the rights and privileges of the individual by standing up for the entire Bill of Rights. Our Federal Government has grown out-of-control and we must return it to its constitutionally enumerated powers.

Benjamin Franklin once said, “Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.” I believe that America can successfully protect itself against potential national security threats without sacrificing our inalienable rights.

We must fiercely guard our Bill of Rights. I will continue to fight for the Constitution, individual liberty and the freedoms that make this country great.

Rand Paul Opposes A One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Education

I believe that education is the great equalizer, but too often our one-size-fits-all system leaves most kids behind. The Federal Government should not dictate what happens in our local classrooms.  I believe we must abolish Common Core and give control back to the states, localities and parents.

An overgrown federal bureaucracy, mandating standards and discounting local input will not lead to innovation.  In order to compete with the rest of the world, our educational system needs innovation.

Parents and teachers should play an active role in their child’s education and should be encouraged to choose the most appropriate educational institution for their child. We should encourage a variety of educational formats—whether it’s public, charter, private, religious, homeschool or online. Our children should not be constricted to a one-size-fits-all format, as implemented by Common Core.

Freedom to educate our children in a variety of formats will lead to competition and innovation. Our children are the future and they show enormous potential. We will see results when we leave the freedom of education in the hands of the local states, localities, teachers, and parents.

Rand Paul Stands With Israel



I’m proud to support Israel, America’s longtime friend and ally in the Middle East.

Israeli cafés and buses are bombed, towns are victimized by hundreds of rockets, and its citizens are attacked by Palestinian terrorists.

It’s time we took a stand for Israel by standing up to the enemies of Israel, the enemies that murder Israeli citizens.

That’s why I proposed a bill called the “Stand with Israel Act” to cut off the flow of U.S. taxpayer dollars to the Palestinian Authority.

As long as the Palestinian Authority is allied with Hamas not one more tax dollar should flow to them.

Rand Paul Believes We Must Fix Social Security and Save it For Younger Generations

Combined with years of wasteful spending by decades of career politicians in Washington, the Social Security trust fund has been left in a fragile condition.

Millions of Americans depend on Social Security and if we are to keep our promises to them, we can no longer ignore the fiscal state of this undoubtedly important program. Continuing to push Social Security reforms into the future will only make solving the problem harder and will require more painful changes for seniors.

During my time in the Senate, I have worked on proposals that would fix the shortfalls in the Social Security program through a gradual increase in the age of full retirement and by means testing yearly earnings, while preserving those benefits for near and current retirees. These changes would only apply to younger Americans who have time to plan for the future.

As President, I will remain committed to fixing the Social Security program, while preserving the system for seniors who have planned their lives around the program and implementing reforms to save the program for younger generations.

Rand Paul Believes We Must Fix Social Security and Save it For Younger Generations

Combined with years of wasteful spending by decades of career politicians in Washington, the Social Security trust fund has been left in a fragile condition.

Millions of Americans depend on Social Security and if we are to keep our promises to them, we can no longer ignore the fiscal state of this undoubtedly important program. Continuing to push Social Security reforms into the future will only make solving the problem harder and will require more painful changes for seniors.

During my time in the Senate, I have worked on proposals that would fix the shortfalls in the Social Security program through a gradual increase in the age of full retirement and by means testing yearly earnings, while preserving those benefits for near and current retirees. These changes would only apply to younger Americans who have time to plan for the future.

As President, I will remain committed to fixing the Social Security program, while preserving the system for seniors who have planned their lives around the program and implementing reforms to save the program for younger generations.

Rand Paul Believes We Must Protect Our Veterans
As a physician, it is particularly upsetting to me when I hear of bad experiences our veterans have had with the Department of Veterans Affairs. These experiences represent a failure of one of our most basic obligations - to provide for those who have worn the uniform and shouldered the burdens of war.

We owe it to the men and women who have served in combat to provide them with quality care for injuries sustained in defense of this nation.  We must provide our veterans the necessary support tools as they adjust back to civilian life.

We consider all veterans, service members and their families to be an important part of our local communities. As President, I will continue to support veterans and service members of this country. It is my strong belief that we must protect those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation.

 http://www.randpaul.com/issue/sanctity-of-life
Rand Paul Believes in the Sanctity of Life

I strongly believe in the sanctity of life. I believe that life begins at conception and that abortion takes the life of an innocent human being. Under the 14th Amendment, it is the government’s duty to protect life as defined in our Constitution.

As a physician, one of the first things we learn is to ‘Do no harm.’  Since Roe v. Wade decision, over 50 million children have been killed in abortion procedures. As President, I would strongly support legislation restricting federal courts from hearing cases like Roe v. Wade, in an effort to stop harming the lives of the unborn.

Our government should not be responsible for funding abortions, and as President, I will attempt to stop the flow of taxpayer dollars to groups who perform or advocate for abortion.

I believe we may be able to save millions of lives, and do no harm, by allowing states to pass their own anti-abortion laws. By giving this power to the states, I sincerely believe we would save hundreds of thousands of lives.

Rand Paul Supports our Second Amendment Rights

As President, I vow to uphold our entire Bill of Rights, but specifically our right to bear arms.

Those who support the second amendment must also vehemently protect the Fourth Amendment. If we are not free from unreasonable and warrantless searches, no one's guns are safe.

I will not support any proposed gun control law which would limit the right to gun ownership by those who are responsible, law-abiding citizens.

In the White House, I will remain vigilant in the fight against infringements on our Second Amendment rights.

Promoting Strong Families to Secure a Strong Future

151028_MarcoRubio_MakeFamilies_Site (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Strong families are the core of American greatness: Without strong families, America’s strong values will not endure, and the American Dream will disappear. Being raised in a stable home by a mother and a father is an incredible privilege but, unfortunately, one that is increasingly rare.

Too often in recent years, through both economic and social policy, Washington has tried to compete with families rather than support and defend them. It has left American families weaker than they once were, and the institutions that teach values and support families, such as churches and civil society groups, are ailing, too.


Federal policy must allow families to flourish and must not discourage marriage. Supporting families in the 21st century will also require new approaches to sustaining proven values.

As President, Marco will:

Reform the Tax Code to Treat Parents Fairly by:

Creating a new $2,500 per child partially refundable tax credit, to allow working parents to keep more of their money and fix the parent tax penalty
Ending the marriage tax penalty without penalizing homemakers (Read more about Marco’s tax plan here.)
Encouraging more paid leave for new parents, caretakers of ailing loved ones, seriously ill employees, and military families, without harmful mandates or costly new entitlements (Read more about Marco’s paid leave plan here.)
Promote a Marriage Culture by:

Speaking out for traditional American values and against the decline of marriage
Allowing states to use anti-poverty dollars on programs that recognize marriage’s crucial role in lifting families out of poverty
Op-Eds and Speeches

Read Marco’s case for his plan to support paid family leave. (Medium, September 25, 2015)

Read and watch Marco’s speech to the 2015 Value Voters Summit.

How Marco Will Help American Farmers and Ranchers Prosper

151012_MarcoRubio_Policy9 (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
America’s farmers have long been an important source of our country’s prosperity. Marco wants to get government out of the way of agriculture so that American farmers and ranchers can build their businesses, compete as exporters, and create jobs.

As President, Marco will:

Repeal Burdensome Regulations on Farmers and Ranchers

Marco will undo the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water Rule, that will dramatically expand federal control over ponds, ditches and streams. Further, he will fight EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and excessive application of the Endangered Species Act, which can, when misused, deem huge swathes of productive land off-limits for agriculture or other beneficial development. In the U.S. Senate, Marco fought the EPA’s attempt to regulate numeric nutrients in Florida waters — and won.

Permanently End the Punitive Death Tax

Marco’s comprehensive pro-growth, pro-family tax reform will permanently end the death tax and allow for immediate expensing of new machinery and equipment. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the plan would raise wages and boost investment dramatically. Read more about his tax plan here.

Oppose New Taxes on Energy

As President, Marco would fight the establishment of a cap-and-trade program or carbon tax, which would act as a new national energy tax on agriculture producers. In addition, Marco will push for other reforms to unleash American energy production and bring down energy costs for farmers.

Open New Markets for Farmers and Ranchers

Marco supports Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which asserts Congress’s role in critical trade negotiations and paves the way for the creation of agricultural jobs. Marco would also push for timely completion of trade agreements to boost exports for American farmers and ranchers.

Curb Overregulation

Farmers and ranchers deal with huge costs imposed by the federal regulations, which interfere in labeling procedures, impose new permitting requirements, land use, and more. Marco has proposed a National Regulatory Budget that would cap the costs federal regulations can impose on the economy, including a limit for each individual agency. This would prevent regulators from imposing costly new rules at whim, and give Congress the ability to rein in regulators. Read more about the idea here.

How Marco Will Stand Up for America’s Gun Owners

151104_MarcoRubio_GunOwners_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
The Second Amendment right to bear arms is one of Americans’ most fundamental rights. Indeed, it is a right that reflects our country’s founding values. Opponents of gun rights often maintain that it is outdated in the age of modern weaponry, but it is as important as ever, and no one knows that better than America’s law-abiding gun owners. Marco understands the threats facing gun owners in part because he’s a gun-owner himself.

The President has no right to restrict the individual right to own a firearm. Yet President Obama’s two terms — with failed attempts at ammunition bans, new restrictions on personal gun sales, and more — has attempted to chip away at the Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton has promised to redouble President Obama’s efforts.

New gun laws will do nothing to deter criminals from obtaining firearms; they will simply be ignored by those who wish to do harm. Meanwhile, new restrictions will infringe on the rights of good, law-abiding Americans who wish to have a gun for hunting, sport, or, most important, the protection of their families.

The horrific mass shootings should prompt us to ask what causes people to commit these acts — like what can be done to improve the way we treat serious mental illness — rather than seize on the weapons they used.

Marco has fought to protect the Second Amendment by:

Voting to block the Manchin-Bloomberg expansion of background checks
Fighting to defund the Department of Justice’s radical “Operation Choke Point” and other federal attacks on law-abiding gun manufacturers and dealers
Pushing to bring fundamental Second Amendment rights back to D.C. residents
Protecting the Second Amendment rights of veterans and their families
Standing against any federal attempt to ban commonly owned sporting rifles and standard capacity magazines
Pushing to make concealed-carry permits function like drivers’ licenses, so gun owners’ constitutional rights don’t end at state lines
Opposing U.S. involvement in the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty
Working to expand opportunities for sportsmen on federal lands
As President, Marco will continue to stand up for the rights of law-abiding gun owners, sportsmen, and hunters.

How to Help America’s Seniors Prosper

151020_MarcoRubio_Senior_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
America’s senior citizens deserve the best we can offer. However, outdated, big-government policies aren’t always offering them the best opportunities for a healthy, prosperous retirement.

For current seniors, Marco will enact reforms to improve their financial well-being and protect the promises we’ve made to them. For future retirees, Marco will modernize and strengthen our programs so they’re available for tomorrow’s seniors.

Here’s how:

Strengthen and Reform Social Security and Medicare

As President, Marco will protect Social Security and Medicare by:

Making no changes for those in or near retirement
Defending Medicare and Medicare Advantage for current seniors
These programs won’t be around for future generations unless something is done to reform them, however. For future retirees, Marco will:

Gradually increase the retirement age for future retirees, to keep up with changes in life expectancy
Reduce the growth in benefits for upper-income seniors while strengthening the program for low-income seniors
Transition Medicare to a premium-support system, which would give seniors a generous but fixed amount with which to purchase health coverage, either from Medicare or a private provider
Boost Seniors’ Incomes

To improve seniors’ economic opportunities, Marco will:

Exempt Americans over 65 who wish to keep working from the payroll tax, strengthening the economy and seniors’ nest eggs
Abolish the Retirement Earnings Test, which discourages work and does nothing to help Social Security’s long-term solvency
Repeal Obamacare and Modernize Our Health System

As President, Marco will repeal Obamacare and strengthen Medicare, which would mean:

Shuttering Obamacare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel of unelected bureaucrats whose ultimate aim is to ration care for the elderly
Strengthening Medicare Advantage, which gives many seniors a choice of plans offering a wide range of benefits
Making the Medicare trust fund permanently solvent, so that every senior enrolled in Medicare today can rely on the program for the rest of his or her life
Giving seniors — and future retirees — more options to choose the coverage they need and the doctors they see
Overhaul Our Tax Code

Marco supports a comprehensive tax reform plan that would eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest, eliminating double taxation on the savings seniors have accumulated over a lifetime of hard work.

His plan would also get rid of the death tax, enabling Americans to pass on their farms, businesses, and hard-earned wealth to their relatives without paying even more in taxes or engaging in complicated tax planning.

Marco Will Stand Up for Small Business Owners

151026_MarcoRubio_SmallBusiness_Post (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Especially in the 21st century, small businesses are the engines of the American economy, driving innovation and creating the bulk of new jobs. Entrepreneurs and family business owners need to be free from overbearing government policy to grow and create. Only in a place like America can employees go to being employers, and it’s a healthy culture of free enterprise and small business ownership that makes that possible.

Unfortunately, American small businesses, like the broader American economy, are struggling. In recent years, more businesses are being destroyed than created. Breaking out of economic stagnation requires reviving American small businesses and enabling them to do what they do best: create good-paying jobs and new opportunities for American workers. Marco plans to do that by restoring sanity to labor law, reforming the federal tax code to promote growth, keeping regulations and costs low, and more.

In the Senate, Marco has received 100% ratings from the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. He has fought against ObamaCare, tax increases, and other policies that would harm small businesses and their workers.

As President, Marco will:

Enact Comprehensive Tax Reform that Protects Small Businesses

Marco supports comprehensive tax reform that will:

Cut taxes for small businesses to 25%;
Let businesses immediately expense new investments;
Permanently repeal the death tax.
Demand Full Repeal of ObamaCare and Its $1 Trillion of Tax Hikes

Repeal ObamaCare in full, including the $1 trillion of tax hikes on workers and employers, in particular the job-destroying employer mandate and obstacles to hiring full-time workers;
Support consumer-centered reforms that lower costs and provide flexibility to businesses.
Read more about Marco’s plan for health care here.

Fight for Accountable Regulatory Policies

Establish a National Regulatory Budget to hold unelected regulators accountable;
Let Congress vote up or down on regulations that have a major impact on the economy;
Expose the true costs of regulations on the American economy and small businesses;
Dramatically increase small business input in the regulatory process.
Pursue Policies that Lower Energy Costs, Fight Policies That Raise Them

Expand responsible production of American-made energy, including oil, coal, natural gas, and renewables;
Immediately approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline;
Fight cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, and new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency that act as a national energy tax.
Establish a Common-Sense Balance Between Worker and Employer Rights

Protect the secret ballot for workers during union elections;
Prohibit unions from siphoning off worker dues for political activities; and
Remove union-imposed obstacles to workers receiving pay increases and bonuses.

What Marco Will Do for Veterans

151007_MarcoRubio_Vets_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Men and women who have served our country deserve our everlasting gratitude, and better treatment than they’re getting right now. The VA system is outdated and broken, and far too many veterans are homeless, unemployed, or impoverished.


Marco has led bipartisan Congressional efforts to reform the VA: He introduced legislation with House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller allowing secretaries of the VA to remove senior executives at the VA based on performance, which was signed to law. Beyond the VA, Marco has helped put in place stronger financial protections for veterans targeted by scammers, promoted efforts to ensure that veterans have additional educational and employment options after their service, and expanded patient-centered health care options for veterans with service-connected disabilities.

By reforming and modernizing the VA, opening up educational and job opportunities that will help veterans, and strengthening the military, as President Marco will make sure our veterans get the treatment they deserve.

VA Reform

Marco has introduced legislation allowing secretaries of the VA to remove any VA employee based on performance or misconduct. Without the basic accountability this measure offers, we’ll never have a VA that works for veterans rather than bureaucrats.

Similarly, competition will push the VA to provide top quality care. If veterans don’t feel like the Veterans Health Administration suits their needs, Marco supports giving them the option to use the exact same funds to see an approved private sector provider of their choice.

Marco will also fight to streamline and reform the VA bureaucracy and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.

Education That Works for Vets

Marco’s plans for higher-ed reform will offer veterans more flexible, up-to-date options for higher education, including an emphasis on vocational training.

New approaches to higher education possible thanks to accreditation reform, for instance, can give veterans better opportunities after leaving the service. What a soldier has done in the military — say, driving a truck or running a logistics operation — should help count toward education and professional certifications here at home.

Restoring Military Strength

Marco’s plans to strengthen the military will ensure that our servicemembers will go into battle with the best training and equipment we can offer. Reversing sequestration, and keeping our forces at the levels we need, will mean that veterans aren’t coming home to pink slips. Military benefits systems also need to be examined and updated to make sense in the 21st century economy, to ensure that pensions and other compensation are attracting the very best to the military.

What Marco Will Do for American Workers

151012_MarcoRubio_Policy7
SHARETWEETEMAIL
If the American economy is to thrive in the 21st Century, American workers need to have all the opportunities possible. Marco supports a wide range of reforms that will modernize our labor rules, create new incentives for job creation, and unleash innovation. Marco’s plans will help workers who have suffered during the Obama administration’s anemic economic recovery.


If the American Dream is to be preserved and expanded to more people than ever before, we need comprehensive economic reforms to help American workers. Marco proposes to:

Empower American Workers

As a Senator, Marco has pushed for updating outdated labor regulations and throwing out rules that empower unions rather than create opportunities for workers. As President, he’ll continue that fight. He plans to:

Lift Union-Imposed Pay Caps on Millions of American Workers: Marco is fighting for the Rewarding Achievement and Incentivizing Successful Employees (RAISE) Act, which removes union-imposed obstacles to pay increases for millions of workers.
Expand Options for Workers: Marco supports allowing employers to provide workers with a choice between receiving monetary compensation or paid leave for working overtime.
Worker Choice: Marco supports giving all workers the choice over whether or not they join a union.
Reform the NLRB: Marco supports reforming the NLRB to ensure that it acts as a neutral arbiter, not an arm of Big Labor to punish the private sector and workers.
Reverse the NLRB’s Disastrous “Joint Employer” Decision: The NLRB’s “joint employer” decision will hurt small businesses, especially franchises. Marco supports reversing this disastrous decision and returning control to small businesses.
Pass Tax Reform

Marco has a comprehensive tax reform plan that will cut taxes for working Americans, jumpstart investment, and slash corporate taxes to boost wages.

The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that it will raise wages for all taxpayers and create millions of jobs. Read more about the plan here.

Protect the Sharing Economy

Marco will oppose harmful new mandates, regulations, and taxes that can get in the way of innovative work opportunities provided by the sharing economy. Read more about that here.

Overhaul Higher Education

Marco proposes modernizing our outdated higher education system so that American workers can get the skills they need at an affordable price and in ways compatible with other priorities. Read more about the proposals here.

Unleash American Energy Potential

Making the best use of America’s energy resources provides abundant opportunities for high-paying jobs, many of which don’t even require a college degree. Marco will lift the ban on crude oil exports, allow states to oversee energy production on federal lands, and more. Read about his energy plans here.

Limit Regulatory Overreach

Marco has proposed a national regulatory budget, which will set a limit on the costs that can be imposed by federal regulations overall and by rules from each federal agency. This will roll back regulators’ ability to strangle job creation and restore Congress’s ability to oversee regulation. Read more about the idea here.

Economic Freedom Agenda
Creating more opportunity for everyone to rise in society and make life better and safer for all American workers—especially blue collar workers—and their families.

Read Rick Santorum's Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal

Read the full Santorum Economic Freedom Agenda

American families are struggling. The last years of the Bush presidency brought tremendous financial hardships. So have the Obama-Biden years. Taxes are soaring. Regulations are mounting. Spending and debt are out of control. Poverty is rising. And chronic economic weakness at home is inviting our enemies to test us abroad.

Hardworking Americans don’t see the system working for them, and many are losing hope. They increasingly fear that the American Dream is dying, that their children won’t have more freedom or opportunities than they did, that America’s best days are behind us, not ahead of us.

America deserves better. Our nation is on the wrong track.

This is why I am running for President: to fight every day to advance an Economic Freedom Agenda that will create more opportunity for everyone to rise in society and make life better and safer for all American workers – especially blue collar workers – and their families.

The 20/20 Flat Tax Plan
The chief causes of low growth and the woeful lack of sufficient job creation are the hideously complex federal income tax code, sky-high corporate tax rates, and the scandal-ridden Internal Revenue Service. Massive job-killing regulations, a completely dysfunctional immigration system, runaway spending and debt, and a host of other foolish Big Government policies further compound the problem.

But the disastrous federal tax code and the IRS that runs it have come to symbolize everything that is wrong with Washington.

It's time to drain the swamp.

My “20/20 Flat Tax Plan” is not the only element of my Economic Freedom Agenda. But it is the centerpiece. These are they key points:

Scrap the Tax Code and Unleash Economic Growth
Abolish the anti-worker, anti-family, anti-growth, anti-freedom federal income tax code once and for all and replace it with a simple, honest, fair rate system - 20% flat tax on individual income / 20% flat tax on business income.
Dramatically downsize, restructure, and reform the IRS.
Fight for American Workers
Aim to make the US, once again, the world's leading manufacturer by providing companies with a jumpstart to compensate for the current uncompetitive system in the form of a 100% income exemption to be phased out over two years and tax deductions for capital investments.
Negotiate Free Trade Agreements with the goal of expanding access to foreign markets for American products and services.
Audit the Federal Reserve and appoint a Fed Chairman committed to maintaining sound money and a strong dollar.
Increase the minimum wage by $0.50 per year for three years to bring it back in line with historical standards.
Cut Spending and Balance/Reform the Federal Budget
Fully repeal Obamacare and all of the taxes that came with it.
Call on Congress and the States to pass a Balanced-Budget Amendment to the Constitution, limiting federal spending to 18% of the GDP.
Submit to Congress a plan that balances the federal budget within five years.
Unleash America's Energy
Approve the Keystone Pipeline for jobs and energy security.
Open up market access to all forms of domestic fuel production.
Give states the freedom to choose where they want to explore for oil and natural gas and to set their own regulations for hydrofracking.
Stop Job-killing Regulation
Vigorously protect the safety and security of American workers and their families while protecting and promoting commonsense conservationist policies to safeguard America's vital natural resources.
Veto or repeal nonsensical laws, regulations, and excessive orders that claim to protect Americans but actually destroy jobs.
Reform Entitlements
Introduce work requirements for means-tested entitlement programs, including the federal food stamps program.
Cut means-tested entitlement programs by 10% across the board, freeze them for four years, and block grant them to States.
Reform and strengthen Medicare and Social Security so they are fiscally sustainable for seniors and future generations.
Stop the Surge of Both Illegal and Legal Immigration
Seal the Mexican border with an American-made wall.
Rescind the Obama-Biden measure that expand and encourage illegal immigration.
Reduce legal immigration by 25% to ensure that Americans get the first shot at new jobs and higher wages.
Veto any legislation aimed at creating amnesty.
Show your support for the Economic Freedom Agenda and the 20/20 Flat Tax by signing the petition and sharing the plan!

 Immigration Reform That Protects American Workers
 We must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.

 Over the past twenty years, nearly 35 million legal and illegal immigrants have come to our shores. This is the largest mass immigration America has seen in our history – even surpassing the Great Wave from the turn of the 20th Century. These immigrants are largely unskilled and low-skilled labor and they are competing for the same jobs as the 74% of Americans who do not have a college degree.

 Every net new job created since 2000 for people between 18 and 65 is held by someone who wasn’t born in this country. This needs to change.

 The American family is the first economy. Just like a business, each family needs revenue, pays expenses, and at the end of the month the books must balance.

 As families struggle in this ever competitive labor market, we must make sure our policies do not throw up further roadblocks and dead ends to their ability to succeed. We must rebuild this first economy, and one step is to ensure we have a responsible immigration policy that puts the American worker and their families first.

 We must reduce immigration levels to the United States in order to protect American workers from foreign labor that is taking jobs that Americans could otherwise hold.

 Key Actions:
 Enforce the law by implementing a biometric tracking system for every immigrant who enters America so we can track who is here and who has overstayed their visa. Anyone apprehended who has overstayed their visa should be subject to fines and then subsequently removed.

 End the practice of sanctuary cities by withholding federal funds from any city that refuses to cooperate with federal authorities.

 Put an end to president Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesty which is largely responsible for the latest border surge.

 Push for congressional action to require all businesses use e-verify for all employees to assure those who play by the rules are rewarded and employers who hire illegal immigrants are held accountable.

 Join every other developed country in the world save one, and put an end to automatic citizenship for children born here to illegal immigrants.

  Valuing the dignity of every human life
  Rick is committed to fighting to ensure that our country always errs on the sides of life.

  Rick and Karen Santorum have a special place in their hearts for children with special needs. Their youngest daughter Bella was born with a serious genetic disorder Trisomy 18. Bella won’t walk and talk like the Santorums’ other children, but her ability to love others is her greatest gift. Since Bella’s birth, Rick and Karen’s commitment to protecting every life – born and unborn – has only been reaffirmed and strengthened. They know that every life matters no matter what physical or mental challenges a person may have. They are committed to fighting to ensure that our country always errs on the sides of life.

  While in the U.S. Senate, Rick authored The Combating Autism Act of 2005 which is now law and provides $860 million over five years to combat autism through research, screening, intervention, and education. He also fought for the passage of the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA).

  Rick Santorum was also an effective voice in opposition to the Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) that could threaten U.S. sovereignty and parental rights. This treaty could have put our country under international law when it comes to parenting our special needs children.

   As a husband and father, Rick Santorum knows the importance of protecting and providing for your family. He believes that at the core of the American experience is the family, and that without strong families, we cannot have a strong and vibrant nation.

   During his time in elected office, Rick Santorum fought for the preservation of the traditional American family and for the protection of the most vulnerable in our society. Rick believes marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and he has fought against efforts to redefine marriage.

   Rick was the author of legislation outlawing the heinous act known as partial-birth abortion and he championed the fight to pass the “Born Alive Infant Protection Act” and the “Unborn Victims of Violence Act.”

   He also authored legislation to advance adult stem cell research, so that ethical research could take place to fight debilitating diseases without the moral implications associated with embryonic stem cell research that destroys human life.

   In 2005, Rick sponsored the Workplace Religious Freedom Act, which would restore provisions in the Civil Rights Act that require employers to accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees.

Common Sense Instead of Common Core
Rick Santorum believes we must rally together to stop any more top-down, nationalized education standards.

Rick Santorum believes we need Common Sense not Common Core. He is opposed to Common Core and any other top-down nationalized education standards - and he has opposed Common Core from the start!

From its beginning, the Common Core State Standards initiative has flown under the radar. Its funding, its implementation, and the substance of the standards it proposes have received little public attention, but all of them are wrong for families, wrong for students, and wrong for our teachers.

Rick is most concerned by how fast these standards were adopted and how little transparency there was in the process. Not one state legislature voted on the Common Core standards. In the forty-five states where they have been adopted, it was by an act of the governor, the state secretary of education, or the state board of education. The people most affected by this enormous policy change—parents and teachers—never had a chance to weigh in.

Rick Santorum believes we must rally together to stop any more top-down, nationalized education standards.

While some states are beginning to retreat on implementation of these standards, many are not, and many more Americans don’t even know what the Common Core standards are since there was so little public debate in their adoption.

Rick Santorum knows that our country’s public education system isn’t working, and we all want to improve opportunities for our children, but more government intervention is not the answer. Instead, parents, teachers, school districts, and local communities should be making the important decisions about education.

 Fighting for the American worker
 Hard-working American families are struggling because no one is fighting for them, and Rick Santorum plans to change that.

 Rick Santorum believes that we need a pro-growth economic agenda, but we must also have a pro-worker economic agenda. Right now, hard-working American families are struggling because no one is fighting for them, and Rick Santorum plans to change that.

 The Santorum economic agenda starts by creating a fairer and flatter tax code that will treat everyone equally under tax law. This means that the IRS role in our lives will be nearly eliminated.

 Just as importantly, the Santorum economic plan will help American businesses - particularly American manufacturers - grow and thrive. Rick grew up in the steel valley of Pittsburgh and knows first-hand the positive impact manufacturing and processing jobs can have on our economy and in our families. These jobs didn't just build strong families and strong communities, they literally built America. Rick believes it’s time to revitalize manufacturing, processing, construction, and energy sectors of our economy again so America can once again thrive.

  End the Immoral Spending in Washington

  Rick Santorum has been fighting for fiscal sanity in Washington for more than a generation. He has long supported a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and a Line Item Veto. He bravely proposed reforming entitlements, cutting spending and even developed a "spendometer" that added up the cost of Democrat amendments to spending bills.

  In the early 1990s, Rick was a member of the "Gang of Seven" that exposed the Congressional Banking and Congressional Post Office scandals. Rick was also an author and floor manager of the landmark Welfare Reform Act of 1996 that has empowered millions of Americans to leave the welfare rolls and enter the workforce.

  Senator Santorum is also a strong supporter “No Budget, No Pay” legislation that would require members of Congress to forgo pay for every day after the beginning of the government’s fiscal year that they don’t adopt a budget and pass all of its spending bills.

REFORMING THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONSHIP TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

How We Got Here: Washington Politicians Let China Off The Hook


In January 2000, President Bill Clinton boldly promised China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (WTO) “is a good deal for America. Our products will gain better access to China’s market, and every sector from agriculture, to telecommunications, to automobiles. But China gains no new market access to the United States.” None of what President Clinton promised came true. Since China joined the WTO, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was  not a good deal for America then and it’s a bad deal now. It is a typical example of how politicians in Washington have failed our country.

The most important component of our China policy is leadership and strength at the negotiating table. We have been too afraid to protect and advance American interests and to challenge China to live up to its obligations. We need smart negotiators who will serve the interests of American workers – not Wall Street insiders that want to move U.S. manufacturing and investment offshore.

The Goal Of The Trump Plan: Fighting For American Businesses And Workers


America has always been a trading nation. Under the Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade. Our goal is not protectionism but accountability. America fully opened its markets to China but China has not reciprocated. Its Great Wall of Protectionism uses unlawful tariff and non-tariff barriers to keep American companies out of China and to tilt the playing field in their favor.

If you give American workers a level playing field, they will win. At its heart, this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China. The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality.

When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over. We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete.

The Trump Plan Will Achieve The Following Goals:

Bring China to the bargaining table by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator.
Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to China’s market.
Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing by putting an end to China’s illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers.
Strengthen our negotiating position by lowering our corporate tax rate to keep American companies and jobs here at home, attacking our debt and deficit so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and bolstering the U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism.
Details of Donald J. Trump’s US China Trade Plan:

Declare China A Currency Manipulator

We need a president who will not succumb to the financial blackmail of a Communist dictatorship. President Obama’s Treasury Department has repeatedly refused to brand China a currency manipulator – a move that would force China to stop these unfair practices or face tough countervailing duties that level the playing field.

Economists estimate the Chinese yuan is undervalued by anywhere from 15% to 40%. This grossly undervalued yuan gives Chinese exporters a huge advantage while imposing the equivalent of a heavy tariff on U.S. exports to China. Such currency manipulation, in concert with China’s other unfair practices, has resulted in chronic U.S. trade deficits, a severe weakening of the U.S. manufacturing base and the loss of tens of millions of American jobs.

In a system of truly free trade and floating exchange rates like a Trump administration would support, America's massive trade deficit with China would not persist. On day one of the Trump administration the U.S. Treasury Department will designate China as a currency manipulator. This will begin a process that imposes appropriate countervailing duties on artificially cheap Chinese products, defends U.S. manufacturers and workers, and revitalizes job growth in America. We must stand up to China’s blackmail and reject corporate America’s manipulation of our politicians. The U.S. Treasury’s designation of China as a currency manipulator will force China to the negotiating table and open the door to a fair – and far better – trading relationship.

End China’s Intellectual Property Violations

China’s ongoing theft of intellectual property may be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. This theft costs the U.S. over $300 billion and millions of jobs each year. China’s government ignores this rampant cybercrime and, in other cases, actively encourages or even sponsors it –without any real consequences. China’s cyber lawlessness threatens our prosperity, privacy and national security. We will enforce stronger protections against Chinese hackers and counterfeit goods and our responses to Chinese theft will be swift, robust, and unequivocal.

The Chinese government also forces American companies like Boeing, GE, and Intel to transfer proprietary technologies to Chinese competitors as a condition of entry into the Chinese market. Such de facto intellectual property theft represents a brazen violation of WTO and international rules. China’s forced technology transfer policy is absolutely ridiculous. Going forward, we will adopt a zero tolerance policy on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer. If China wants to trade with America, they must agree to stop stealing and to play by the rules.

Eliminate China’s Illegal Export Subsidies And Other Unfair Advantages

Chinese manufacturers and other exporters receive numerous illegal export subsidies from the Chinese government. These include - in direct contradiction to WTO rules - free or nearly free rent, utilities, raw materials, and many other services. China’s state-run banks routinely extend loans these enterprises at below market rates or without the expectation they will be repaid. China even offers them illegal tax breaks or rebates as well as cash bonuses to stimulate exports.

China’s illegal export subsidies intentionally distorts international trade and damages other countries’ exports by giving Chinese companies an unfair advantage. From textile and steel mills in the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast’s shrimp and fish industries to the Midwest manufacturing belt and California’s agribusiness, China’s disregard for WTO rules hurt every corner of America.

The U.S. Trade Representative recently filed yet another complaint with the WTO accusing China of cheating on our trade agreements by subsidizing its exports. The Trump administration will not wait for an international body to tell us what we already know. To gain negotiating leverage, we will pursue the WTO case and aggressively highlight and expose these subsidies.

China’s woeful lack of reasonable environmental and labor standards represent yet another form of unacceptable export subsidy. How can American manufacturers, who must meet very high standards, possibly compete with Chinese companies that care nothing about their workers or the environment? We will challenge China to join the 21 st Century when it comes to such standards.

The Trump Plan Will Strengthen Our Negotiating Position

As the world’s most important economy and consumer of goods, America must always negotiate trade agreements from strength. Branding China as a currency manipulator and exposing their unfair trade practices is not enough. In order to further strengthen our negotiating leverage, the Trump plan will:

Lower the corporate tax rate to 15% to unleash American ingenuity here at home and make us more globally competitive. This tax cut puts our rate 10 percentage points below China and 20 points below our current burdensome rate that pushes companies and jobs offshore.
Attack our debt and deficit by vigorously eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal government, ending redundant government programs, and growing the economy to increase tax revenues. Closing the deficit and reducing our debt will mean China cannot blackmail us with our own Treasury bonds.
Strengthen the U.S. military and deploying it appropriately in the East and South China Seas. These actions will discourage Chinese adventurism that imperils American interests in Asia and shows our strength as we begin renegotiating our trading relationship with China. A strong military presence will be a clear signal to China and other nations in Asia and around the world that America is back in the global leadership business.

VETERANS ADMINISTRATION REFORMS THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan

The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is absolutely unacceptable. Over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care. Corruption and incompetence were excused. Politicians in Washington have done too little too slowly to fix it. This situation can never happen again, and when Donald J. Trump is president, it will be fixed – fast.

The guiding principle of the Trump plan is ensuring veterans have convenient access to the best quality care. To further this principle, the Trump plan will decrease wait times, improve healthcare outcomes, and facilitate a seamless transition from service into civilian life.

The Trump Plan Will:

Ensure our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting for backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support they earned with their service to our country.
Support the whole veteran, not just their physical health care, but also by addressing their invisible wounds, investing in our service members’ post-active duty success, transforming the VA to meet the needs of 21st century service members, and better meeting the needs of our female veterans.
Make the VA great again by firing the corrupt and incompetent VA executives who let our veterans down, by modernizing the VA, and by empowering the doctors and nurses to ensure our veterans receive the best care available in a timely manner.
The Trump Plan Gives Veterans The Freedom To Choose And Forces The VA To Compete For Their Dollars

Politicians in Washington have tried to fix the VA by holding hearings and blindly throwing money at the problem. None of it has worked. In fact, wait times were 50% higher this summer than they were a year ago. That’s because the VA lacks the right leadership and management. It’s time we stop trusting Washington politicians to fix the problems and empower our veterans to vote with their feet.

Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately. Our veterans have earned the freedom to choose better or more convenient care from the doctor and facility of their choice. The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars. The VA will become more responsive to veterans, develop more efficient systems, and improve the quality of care because it will have no other choice.

The Trump Plan Treats The Whole Veteran

We must care for the whole veteran, not just their physical health. We must recognize that today’s veterans have very different needs than those of the Greatest Generation.

The Trump Plan Will:

Increase funding for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury and suicide prevention services to address our veterans’ invisible wounds. Service members are five times more likely to develop depression than civilians. They are almost fifteen times more likely to develop PTSD than civilians. This funding will help provide more and better counseling and care. More funding will also support research on best practices and state of the art treatments to keep our veterans alive, healthy and whole. With these steps, the Trump plan will help the veteran community put the unnecessary stigma surrounding mental health behind them and instead encourage acceptance and treatment in our greater society.
Increase funding for job training and placement services (including incentives for companies hiring veterans), educational support and business loans. All Americans agree that we must do everything we can to help put our service men and women on a path to success as they leave active duty by collaborating with the many successful non-profit organizations that are already helping. Service members have learned valuable skills in the military but many need help understanding how to apply those skills in civilian life. Others know how to apply those skills but need help connecting with good jobs to support their families. Still others have an entrepreneurial spirit and are ready to start creating jobs and growing the economy. The Trump plan will strengthen existing programs or replace them with more effective ones to address these needs and to get our veterans working.
Transform the VA to meet the needs of 21st century service members. Today’s veterans have very different needs than those of the generations that came before them. The VA must adapt to meet the needs of this generation of younger, more diverse veterans. The Trump plan will expand VA services for female veterans and ensure the VA is providing the right support for this new generation of veterans.
Better support our women veterans. The fact that many VA hospitals don’t permanently staff OBGYN doctors shows an utter lack of respect for the growing number female veterans. Under the Trump plan, every VA hospital in the country will be fully equipped with OBGYN and other women’s health services. In addition, women veterans can always choose a different OBGYN in their community using their veteran’s ID card.

The Trump Plan Will Make The VA Great Again

The VA health care program is a disaster. Some candidates want to get rid of it, but our veterans need the VA to be there for them and their families. That’s why the Trump plan will:

Fire the corrupt and incompetent VA executives that let our veterans down. Under a Trump Administration, there will be no job security for VA executives that enabled or overlooked corruption and incompetence. They’re fired. New leadership will focus the VA staff on delivering timely, top quality care and other services to our nation’s veterans. Under a Trump Administration, exposing and addressing the VA’s inefficiencies and shortcomings will be rewarded, not punished.
End waste, fraud and abuse at the VA. The Trump plan will ensure the VA is spending its dollars wisely to provide the greatest impact for veterans and hold administrators accountable for irresponsible spending and abuse. The days of $6.3 million for statues and fountains at VA facilities and $300,000 for a manager to move 140 miles are over. The Trump plan will clean up the VA’s finances so the current VA budget provides more and better care than it does now.
Modernize the VA. A VA with 20th century technology cannot serve 21st century service members and their needs. The VA has been promising to modernize for years without real results. The Trump plan will make it happen by accelerating and expanding investments in state of the art technology to deliver best-in-class care quickly and effectively. All veterans should be able to conveniently schedule appointments, communicate with their doctors, and view accurate wait times with the push of a button.
Empower the caregivers to ensure our veterans receive quality care quickly. Caregivers should be able to easily streamline treatment plans across departments and utilize telehealth tools to better serve their patients. As we have seen from the private sector, the potential for new, innovative technology is endless. Abandoning the wasteful and archaic mindset of the public sector will give way to tremendously effective veteran healthcare.
Hire more veterans to care for veterans. The more veterans we have working at the VA, the better the VA will be. They understand the unique challenges facing their community. To increase the number of veterans hired by the VA, this plan will add an additional 5 points to the qualifying scores of veterans applying for VA jobs.
Embed satellite VA clinics in rural and other underserved areas. The Trump Administration will embed satellite VA clinics within hospitals and other care facilities in rural and other underserved areas. This step will ensure veterans have easy access to care and local hospitals and care facilities can handle the influx of patients without backlogs while tapping the specialized knowledge of VA health specialists.

TAX REFORM THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Tax Plan

Too few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many middle class families cannot make ends meet. This tax plan directly meets these challenges with four simple goals:

Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money.
Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again.
Doesn’t add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.
The Trump Tax Plan Achieves These Goals

If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, “I win,” those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.
All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets – 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% – instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II.
No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America’s tax rate one of the best in the world.
No family will have to pay the death tax. You earned and saved that money for your family, not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it.
The Trump Tax Plan Is Revenue Neutral

The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:

Reducing or eliminating most deductions and loopholes available to the very rich.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
Reducing or eliminating corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.

DETAILS OF DONALD J. TRUMP’S TAX PLAN

America needs a bold, simple and achievable plan based on conservative economic principles. This plan does that with needed tax relief for all Americans, especially the working poor and middle class, pro-growth tax reform for all sizes of businesses, and fiscally responsible steps to ensure this plan does not add to our enormous debt and deficit.

This plan simplifies the tax code by taking nearly 50% of current filers off the income tax rolls entirely and reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four for everyone else. This plan also reduces or eliminates loopholes used by the very rich and special interests made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rates on individuals and companies.

The Trump Tax Plan: A Simpler Tax Code For All Americans

When the income tax was first introduced, just one percent of Americans had to pay it. It was never intended as a tax most Americans would pay. The Trump plan eliminates the income tax for over 73 million households. 42 million households that currently file complex forms to determine they don’t owe any income taxes will now file a one page form saving them time, stress, uncertainty and an average of $110 in preparation costs. Over 31 million households get the same simplification and keep on average nearly $1,000 of their hard-earned money.

For those Americans who will still pay the income tax, the tax rates will go from the current seven brackets to four simpler, fairer brackets that eliminate the marriage penalty and the AMT while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II:

Income Tax Rate	Long Term Cap Gains/ Dividends Rate	Single Filers	Married Filers	Heads of Household
0%	0%	$0 to $25,000	$0 to $50,000	$0 to $37,500
10%	0%	$25,001 to $50,000	$50,001 to $100,000	$37,501 to $75,000
20%	15%	$50,001 to $150,000	$100,001 to $300,000	$75,001 to $225,000
25%	20%	$150,001 and up	$300,001 and up	$225,001 and up
With this huge reduction in rates, many of the current exemptions and deductions will become unnecessary or redundant. Those within the 10% bracket will keep all or most of their current deductions. Those within the 20% bracket will keep more than half of their current deductions. Those within the 25% bracket will keep fewer deductions. Charitable giving and mortgage interest deductions will remain unchanged for all taxpayers.

Simplifying the tax code and cutting every American’s taxes will boost consumer spending, encourage savings and investment, and maximize economic growth.

Business Tax Reform To Encourage Jobs And Spur Economic Growth

Too many companies – from great American brands to innovative startups – are leaving America, either directly or through corporate inversions. The Democrats want to outlaw inversions, but that will never work. Companies leaving is not the disease, it is the symptom. Politicians in Washington have let America fall from the best corporate tax rate in the industrialized world in the 1980’s (thanks to Ronald Reagan) to the worst rate in the industrialized world. That is unacceptable. Under the Trump plan, America will compete with the world and win by cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, taking our rate from one of the worst to one of the best.

This lower tax rate cannot be for big business alone; it needs to help the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy. Right now, freelancers, sole proprietors, unincorporated small businesses and pass-through entities are taxed at the high personal income tax rates. This treatment stifles small businesses. It also stifles tax reform because efforts to reduce loopholes and deductions available to the very rich and special interests end up hitting small businesses and job creators as well. The Trump plan addresses this challenge head on with a new business income tax rate within the personal income tax code that matches the 15% corporate tax rate to help these businesses, entrepreneurs and freelancers grow and prosper.

These lower rates will provide a tremendous stimulus for the economy – significant GDP growth, a huge number of new jobs and an increase in after-tax wages for workers.

The Trump Tax Plan Ends The Unfair Death Tax

The death tax punishes families for achieving the American dream. Therefore, the Trump plan eliminates the death tax.

The Trump Tax Plan Is Fiscally Responsible

The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:

Reducing or eliminating deductions and loopholes available to the very rich, starting by steepening the curve of the Personal Exemption Phaseout and the Pease Limitation on itemized deductions. The Trump plan also phases out the tax exemption on life insurance interest for high-income earners, ends the current tax treatment of carried interest for speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital, and reduces or eliminates other loopholes for the very rich and special interests. These reductions and eliminations will not harm the economy or hurt the middle class. Because the Trump plan introduces a new business income rate within the personal income tax code, they will not harm small businesses either.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate. Since we are making America’s corporate tax rate globally competitive, it is only fair that corporations help make that move fiscally responsible. U.S.-owned corporations have as much as $2.5 trillion in cash sitting overseas. Some companies have been leaving cash overseas as a tax maneuver. Under this plan, they can bring their cash home and put it to work in America while benefitting from the newly-lowered corporate tax rate that is globally competitive and no longer requires parking cash overseas. Other companies have cash overseas for specific business units or activities. They can leave that cash overseas, but they will still have to pay the one-time repatriation fee.
An end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Corporations will no longer be allowed to defer taxes on income earned abroad, but the foreign tax credit will remain in place because no company should face double taxation.
Reducing or eliminating some corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.

PROTECTING OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Donald J. Trump on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms

The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.

The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans. The Constitution doesn’t create that right – it ensures that the government can’t take it away. Our Founding Fathers knew, and our Supreme Court has upheld, that the Second Amendment’s purpose is to guarantee our right to defend ourselves and our families. This is about self-defense, plain and simple.

It’s been said that the Second Amendment is America’s first freedom. That’s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment. Protecting that freedom is imperative. Here’s how we will do that:

Enforce The Laws On The Books

We need to get serious about prosecuting violent criminals. The Obama administration’s record on that is abysmal. Violent crime in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and many others is out of control. Drug dealers and gang members are given a slap on the wrist and turned loose on the street. This needs to stop.

Several years ago there was a tremendous program in Richmond, Virginia called Project Exile. It said that if a violent felon uses a gun to commit a crime, you will be prosecuted in federal court and go to prison for five years – no parole or early release. Obama’s former Attorney General, Eric Holder, called that a “cookie cutter” program. That’s ridiculous. I call that program a success. Murders committed with guns in Richmond decreased by over 60% when Project Exile was in place – in the first two years of the program alone, 350 armed felons were taken off the street.

Why does that matter to law-abiding gun owners? Because they’re the ones who anti-gun politicians and the media blame when criminals misuse guns. We need to bring back and expand programs like Project Exile and get gang members and drug dealers off the street. When we do, crime will go down and our cities and communities will be safer places to live.

Here’s another important way to fight crime – empower law-abiding gun owners to defend themselves. Law enforcement is great, they do a tremendous job, but they can’t be everywhere all of the time. Our personal protection is ultimately up to us. That’s why I’m a gun owner, that’s why I have a concealed carry permit, and that’s why tens of millions of Americans have concealed carry permits as well. It’s just common sense. To make America great again, we’re going to go after criminals and put the law back on the side of the law-abiding.

Fix Our Broken Mental Health System

Let’s be clear about this. Our mental health system is broken. It needs to be fixed. Too many politicians have ignored this problem for too long.

All of the tragic mass murders that occurred in the past several years have something in common – there were red flags that were ignored. We can’t allow that to continue. We need to expand treatment programs, because most people with mental health problems aren’t violent, they just need help. But for those who are violent, a danger to themselves or others, we need to get them off the street before they can terrorize our communities. This is just common sense.

And why does this matter to law-abiding gun owners? Once again, because they get blamed by anti-gun politicians, gun control groups and the media for the acts of deranged madmen. When one of these tragedies occurs, we can count on two things: one, that opponents of gun rights will immediately exploit it to push their political agenda; and two, that none of their so-called “solutions” would have prevented the tragedy in the first place. They’ve even admitted it.

We need real solutions to address real problems. Not grandstanding or political agendas.

Defend The Rights of Law-Abiding Gun Owners

GUN AND MAGAZINE BANS. Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. That’s been proven every time it’s been tried. Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like “assault weapons”, “military-style weapons” and “high capacity magazines” to confuse people. What they’re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans. Law-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice. The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.

BACKGROUND CHECKS. There has been a national background check system in place since 1998. Every time a person buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer – which is the overwhelming majority of all gun purchases – they go through a federal background check. Study after study has shown that very few criminals are stupid enough to try and pass a background check – they get their guns from friends/family members or by stealing them. So the overwhelming majority of people who go through background checks are law-abiding gun owners. When the system was created, gun owners were promised that it would be instant, accurate and fair. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case today. Too many states are failing to put criminal and mental health records into the system – and it should go without saying that a system’s only going to be as effective as the records that are put into it. What we need to do is fix the system we have and make it work as intended. What we don’t need to do is expand a broken system.

NATIONAL RIGHT TO CARRY. The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That’s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving – which is a privilege, not a right – then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.

MILITARY BASES AND RECRUITING CENTERS. Banning our military from carrying firearms on bases and at recruiting centers is ridiculous. We train our military how to safely and responsibly use firearms, but our current policies leave them defenseless. To make America great again, we need a strong military. To have a strong military, we need to allow them to defend themselves.

IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

The three core principles of Donald J. Trump's immigration plan

When politicians talk about “immigration reform” they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties.

Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first – not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own. That must change. Here are the three core principles of real immigration reform:

1. A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border.

2. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced.

3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans.

Make Mexico Pay For The Wall

For many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country (as well as in other Latin American countries). They have even published pamphlets on how to illegally immigrate to the United States. The costs for the United States have been extraordinary: U.S. taxpayers have been asked to pick up hundreds of billions in healthcare costs, housing costs, education costs, welfare costs, etc. Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011. The effects on jobseekers have also been disastrous, and black Americans have been particularly harmed.

The impact in terms of crime has been tragic. In recent weeks, the headlines have been covered with cases of criminals who crossed our border illegally only to go on to commit horrific crimes against Americans. Most recently, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, with a long arrest record, is charged with breaking into a 64 year-old woman’s home, crushing her skull and eye sockets with a hammer, raping her, and murdering her. The Police Chief in Santa Maria says the “blood trail” leads straight to Washington.

In 2011, the Government Accountability Office found that there were a shocking 3 million arrests attached to the incarcerated alien population, including tens of thousands of violent beatings, rapes and murders.

Meanwhile, Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States back to Mexico ($22 billion in 2013 alone).

In short, the Mexican government has taken the United States to the cleaners. They are responsible for this problem, and they must help pay to clean it up.

The cost of building a permanent border wall pales mightily in comparison to what American taxpayers spend every single year on dealing with the fallout of illegal immigration on their communities, schools and unemployment offices.

Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards – of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].  We will not be taken advantage of anymore.

Defend The Laws And Constitution Of The United States

America will only be great as long as America remains a nation of laws that lives according to the Constitution. No one is above the law. The following steps will return to the American people the safety of their laws, which politicians have stolen from them:

Triple the number of ICE officers. As the President of the ICE Officers’ Council explained in Congressional testimony: “Only approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion’s share of ICE’s immigration mission…Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States. Since 9-11, the U.S. Border Patrol has tripled in size, while ICE’s immigration enforcement arm, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), has remained at relatively the same size.” This will be funded by accepting the recommendation of the Inspector General for Tax Administration and eliminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.

Nationwide e-verify. This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans.

Mandatory return of all criminal aliens. The Obama Administration has released 76,000 aliens from its custody with criminal convictions since 2013 alone. All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally.

Detention—not catch-and-release. Illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border must be detained until they are sent home, no more catch-and-release.

Defund sanctuary cities. Cut-off federal grants to any city which refuses to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

Enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa. Millions of people come to the United States on temporary visas but refuse to leave, without consequence. This is a threat to national security. Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties; this will also help give local jurisdictions the power to hold visa overstays until federal authorities arrive. Completion of a visa tracking system – required by law but blocked by lobbyists – will be necessary as well.

Cooperate with local gang task forces. ICE officers should accompany local police departments conducting raids of violent street gangs like MS-13 and the 18th street gang, which have terrorized the country. All illegal aliens in gangs should be apprehended and deported. Again, quoting Chris Crane: “ICE Officers and Agents are forced to apply the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Directive, not to children in schools, but to adult inmates in jails. If an illegal-alien inmate simply claims eligibility, ICE is forced to release the alien back into the community. This includes serious criminals who have committed felonies, who have assaulted officers, and who prey on children…ICE officers should be required to place detainers on every illegal alien they encounter in jails and prisons, since these aliens not only violated immigration laws, but then went on to engage in activities that led to their arrest by police; ICE officers should be required to issue Notices to Appear to all illegal aliens with criminal convictions, DUI convictions, or a gang affiliation; ICE should be working with any state or local drug or gang task force that asks for such assistance.”

End birthright citizenship. This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration. By a 2:1 margin, voters say it’s the wrong policy, including Harry Reid who said “no sane country” would give automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.

Put American Workers First

Decades of disastrous trade deals and immigration policies have destroyed our middle class. Today, nearly 40% of black teenagers are unemployed. Nearly 30% of Hispanic teenagers are unemployed. For black Americans without high school diplomas, the bottom has fallen out: more than 70% were employed in 1960, compared to less than 40% in 2000. Across the economy, the percentage of adults in the labor force has collapsed to a level not experienced in generations. As CBS news wrote in a piece entitled “America’s incredible shrinking middle class”: “If the middle-class is the economic backbone of America, then the country is developing osteoporosis.”

The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans – including immigrants themselves and their children – to earn a middle class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants. Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants. We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.

Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm. From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers, and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us. The President of the immigration caseworkers union declared in a statement on ISIS: “We've become the visa clearinghouse for the world.”

Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform:

Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.

Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.

End welfare abuse. Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S.

Jobs program for inner city youth. The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program.

Refugee program for American children. Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to crack down on abuses. Use the monies saved on expensive refugee programs to help place American children without parents in safer homes and communities, and to improve community safety in high crime neighborhoods in the United States.

Immigration moderation. Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers. This will help reverse women's plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages.
