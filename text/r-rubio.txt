Promoting Strong Families to Secure a Strong Future

151028_MarcoRubio_MakeFamilies_Site (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Strong families are the core of American greatness: Without strong families, America’s strong values will not endure, and the American Dream will disappear. Being raised in a stable home by a mother and a father is an incredible privilege but, unfortunately, one that is increasingly rare.

Too often in recent years, through both economic and social policy, Washington has tried to compete with families rather than support and defend them. It has left American families weaker than they once were, and the institutions that teach values and support families, such as churches and civil society groups, are ailing, too.


Federal policy must allow families to flourish and must not discourage marriage. Supporting families in the 21st century will also require new approaches to sustaining proven values.

As President, Marco will:

Reform the Tax Code to Treat Parents Fairly by:

Creating a new $2,500 per child partially refundable tax credit, to allow working parents to keep more of their money and fix the parent tax penalty
Ending the marriage tax penalty without penalizing homemakers (Read more about Marco’s tax plan here.)
Encouraging more paid leave for new parents, caretakers of ailing loved ones, seriously ill employees, and military families, without harmful mandates or costly new entitlements (Read more about Marco’s paid leave plan here.)
Promote a Marriage Culture by:

Speaking out for traditional American values and against the decline of marriage
Allowing states to use anti-poverty dollars on programs that recognize marriage’s crucial role in lifting families out of poverty
Op-Eds and Speeches

How Marco Will Help American Farmers and Ranchers Prosper

151012_MarcoRubio_Policy9 (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
America’s farmers have long been an important source of our country’s prosperity. Marco wants to get government out of the way of agriculture so that American farmers and ranchers can build their businesses, compete as exporters, and create jobs.

As President, Marco will:

Repeal Burdensome Regulations on Farmers and Ranchers

Marco will undo the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water Rule, that will dramatically expand federal control over ponds, ditches and streams. Further, he will fight EPA regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and excessive application of the Endangered Species Act, which can, when misused, deem huge swathes of productive land off-limits for agriculture or other beneficial development. In the U.S. Senate, Marco fought the EPA’s attempt to regulate numeric nutrients in Florida waters — and won.

Permanently End the Punitive Death Tax

Marco’s comprehensive pro-growth, pro-family tax reform will permanently end the death tax and allow for immediate expensing of new machinery and equipment. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the plan would raise wages and boost investment dramatically. Read more about his tax plan here.

Oppose New Taxes on Energy

As President, Marco would fight the establishment of a cap-and-trade program or carbon tax, which would act as a new national energy tax on agriculture producers. In addition, Marco will push for other reforms to unleash American energy production and bring down energy costs for farmers.

Open New Markets for Farmers and Ranchers

Marco supports Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which asserts Congress’s role in critical trade negotiations and paves the way for the creation of agricultural jobs. Marco would also push for timely completion of trade agreements to boost exports for American farmers and ranchers.

Curb Overregulation

Farmers and ranchers deal with huge costs imposed by the federal regulations, which interfere in labeling procedures, impose new permitting requirements, land use, and more. Marco has proposed a National Regulatory Budget that would cap the costs federal regulations can impose on the economy, including a limit for each individual agency. This would prevent regulators from imposing costly new rules at whim, and give Congress the ability to rein in regulators. Read more about the idea here.

How Marco Will Stand Up for America’s Gun Owners

151104_MarcoRubio_GunOwners_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
The Second Amendment right to bear arms is one of Americans’ most fundamental rights. Indeed, it is a right that reflects our country’s founding values. Opponents of gun rights often maintain that it is outdated in the age of modern weaponry, but it is as important as ever, and no one knows that better than America’s law-abiding gun owners. Marco understands the threats facing gun owners in part because he’s a gun-owner himself.

The President has no right to restrict the individual right to own a firearm. Yet President Obama’s two terms — with failed attempts at ammunition bans, new restrictions on personal gun sales, and more — has attempted to chip away at the Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton has promised to redouble President Obama’s efforts.

New gun laws will do nothing to deter criminals from obtaining firearms; they will simply be ignored by those who wish to do harm. Meanwhile, new restrictions will infringe on the rights of good, law-abiding Americans who wish to have a gun for hunting, sport, or, most important, the protection of their families.

The horrific mass shootings should prompt us to ask what causes people to commit these acts — like what can be done to improve the way we treat serious mental illness — rather than seize on the weapons they used.

Marco has fought to protect the Second Amendment by:

Voting to block the Manchin-Bloomberg expansion of background checks
Fighting to defund the Department of Justice’s radical “Operation Choke Point” and other federal attacks on law-abiding gun manufacturers and dealers
Pushing to bring fundamental Second Amendment rights back to D.C. residents
Protecting the Second Amendment rights of veterans and their families
Standing against any federal attempt to ban commonly owned sporting rifles and standard capacity magazines
Pushing to make concealed-carry permits function like drivers’ licenses, so gun owners’ constitutional rights don’t end at state lines
Opposing U.S. involvement in the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty
Working to expand opportunities for sportsmen on federal lands
As President, Marco will continue to stand up for the rights of law-abiding gun owners, sportsmen, and hunters.

How to Help America’s Seniors Prosper

151020_MarcoRubio_Senior_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
America’s senior citizens deserve the best we can offer. However, outdated, big-government policies aren’t always offering them the best opportunities for a healthy, prosperous retirement.

For current seniors, Marco will enact reforms to improve their financial well-being and protect the promises we’ve made to them. For future retirees, Marco will modernize and strengthen our programs so they’re available for tomorrow’s seniors.

Here’s how:

Strengthen and Reform Social Security and Medicare

As President, Marco will protect Social Security and Medicare by:

Making no changes for those in or near retirement
Defending Medicare and Medicare Advantage for current seniors
These programs won’t be around for future generations unless something is done to reform them, however. For future retirees, Marco will:

Gradually increase the retirement age for future retirees, to keep up with changes in life expectancy
Reduce the growth in benefits for upper-income seniors while strengthening the program for low-income seniors
Transition Medicare to a premium-support system, which would give seniors a generous but fixed amount with which to purchase health coverage, either from Medicare or a private provider
Boost Seniors’ Incomes

To improve seniors’ economic opportunities, Marco will:

Exempt Americans over 65 who wish to keep working from the payroll tax, strengthening the economy and seniors’ nest eggs
Abolish the Retirement Earnings Test, which discourages work and does nothing to help Social Security’s long-term solvency
Repeal Obamacare and Modernize Our Health System

As President, Marco will repeal Obamacare and strengthen Medicare, which would mean:

Shuttering Obamacare’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel of unelected bureaucrats whose ultimate aim is to ration care for the elderly
Strengthening Medicare Advantage, which gives many seniors a choice of plans offering a wide range of benefits
Making the Medicare trust fund permanently solvent, so that every senior enrolled in Medicare today can rely on the program for the rest of his or her life
Giving seniors — and future retirees — more options to choose the coverage they need and the doctors they see
Overhaul Our Tax Code

Marco supports a comprehensive tax reform plan that would eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest, eliminating double taxation on the savings seniors have accumulated over a lifetime of hard work.

His plan would also get rid of the death tax, enabling Americans to pass on their farms, businesses, and hard-earned wealth to their relatives without paying even more in taxes or engaging in complicated tax planning.

Marco Will Stand Up for Small Business Owners

151026_MarcoRubio_SmallBusiness_Post (1)
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Especially in the 21st century, small businesses are the engines of the American economy, driving innovation and creating the bulk of new jobs. Entrepreneurs and family business owners need to be free from overbearing government policy to grow and create. Only in a place like America can employees go to being employers, and it’s a healthy culture of free enterprise and small business ownership that makes that possible.

Unfortunately, American small businesses, like the broader American economy, are struggling. In recent years, more businesses are being destroyed than created. Breaking out of economic stagnation requires reviving American small businesses and enabling them to do what they do best: create good-paying jobs and new opportunities for American workers. Marco plans to do that by restoring sanity to labor law, reforming the federal tax code to promote growth, keeping regulations and costs low, and more.

In the Senate, Marco has received 100% ratings from the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council. He has fought against ObamaCare, tax increases, and other policies that would harm small businesses and their workers.

As President, Marco will:

Enact Comprehensive Tax Reform that Protects Small Businesses

Marco supports comprehensive tax reform that will:

Cut taxes for small businesses to 25%;
Let businesses immediately expense new investments;
Permanently repeal the death tax.
Demand Full Repeal of ObamaCare and Its $1 Trillion of Tax Hikes

Repeal ObamaCare in full, including the $1 trillion of tax hikes on workers and employers, in particular the job-destroying employer mandate and obstacles to hiring full-time workers;
Support consumer-centered reforms that lower costs and provide flexibility to businesses.
Read more about Marco’s plan for health care here.

Fight for Accountable Regulatory Policies

Establish a National Regulatory Budget to hold unelected regulators accountable;
Let Congress vote up or down on regulations that have a major impact on the economy;
Expose the true costs of regulations on the American economy and small businesses;
Dramatically increase small business input in the regulatory process.
Pursue Policies that Lower Energy Costs, Fight Policies That Raise Them

Expand responsible production of American-made energy, including oil, coal, natural gas, and renewables;
Immediately approve construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline;
Fight cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, and new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency that act as a national energy tax.
Establish a Common-Sense Balance Between Worker and Employer Rights

Protect the secret ballot for workers during union elections;
Prohibit unions from siphoning off worker dues for political activities; and
Remove union-imposed obstacles to workers receiving pay increases and bonuses.

What Marco Will Do for Veterans

151007_MarcoRubio_Vets_Post
SHARETWEETEMAIL
Men and women who have served our country deserve our everlasting gratitude, and better treatment than they’re getting right now. The VA system is outdated and broken, and far too many veterans are homeless, unemployed, or impoverished.


Marco has led bipartisan Congressional efforts to reform the VA: He introduced legislation with House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller allowing secretaries of the VA to remove senior executives at the VA based on performance, which was signed to law. Beyond the VA, Marco has helped put in place stronger financial protections for veterans targeted by scammers, promoted efforts to ensure that veterans have additional educational and employment options after their service, and expanded patient-centered health care options for veterans with service-connected disabilities.

By reforming and modernizing the VA, opening up educational and job opportunities that will help veterans, and strengthening the military, as President Marco will make sure our veterans get the treatment they deserve.

VA Reform

Marco has introduced legislation allowing secretaries of the VA to remove any VA employee based on performance or misconduct. Without the basic accountability this measure offers, we’ll never have a VA that works for veterans rather than bureaucrats.

Similarly, competition will push the VA to provide top quality care. If veterans don’t feel like the Veterans Health Administration suits their needs, Marco supports giving them the option to use the exact same funds to see an approved private sector provider of their choice.

Marco will also fight to streamline and reform the VA bureaucracy and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.

Education That Works for Vets

Marco’s plans for higher-ed reform will offer veterans more flexible, up-to-date options for higher education, including an emphasis on vocational training.

New approaches to higher education possible thanks to accreditation reform, for instance, can give veterans better opportunities after leaving the service. What a soldier has done in the military — say, driving a truck or running a logistics operation — should help count toward education and professional certifications here at home.

Restoring Military Strength

Marco’s plans to strengthen the military will ensure that our servicemembers will go into battle with the best training and equipment we can offer. Reversing sequestration, and keeping our forces at the levels we need, will mean that veterans aren’t coming home to pink slips. Military benefits systems also need to be examined and updated to make sense in the 21st century economy, to ensure that pensions and other compensation are attracting the very best to the military.

What Marco Will Do for American Workers

151012_MarcoRubio_Policy7
SHARETWEETEMAIL
If the American economy is to thrive in the 21st Century, American workers need to have all the opportunities possible. Marco supports a wide range of reforms that will modernize our labor rules, create new incentives for job creation, and unleash innovation. Marco’s plans will help workers who have suffered during the Obama administration’s anemic economic recovery.


If the American Dream is to be preserved and expanded to more people than ever before, we need comprehensive economic reforms to help American workers. Marco proposes to:

Empower American Workers

As a Senator, Marco has pushed for updating outdated labor regulations and throwing out rules that empower unions rather than create opportunities for workers. As President, he’ll continue that fight. He plans to:

Lift Union-Imposed Pay Caps on Millions of American Workers: Marco is fighting for the Rewarding Achievement and Incentivizing Successful Employees (RAISE) Act, which removes union-imposed obstacles to pay increases for millions of workers.
Expand Options for Workers: Marco supports allowing employers to provide workers with a choice between receiving monetary compensation or paid leave for working overtime.
Worker Choice: Marco supports giving all workers the choice over whether or not they join a union.
Reform the NLRB: Marco supports reforming the NLRB to ensure that it acts as a neutral arbiter, not an arm of Big Labor to punish the private sector and workers.
Reverse the NLRB’s Disastrous “Joint Employer” Decision: The NLRB’s “joint employer” decision will hurt small businesses, especially franchises. Marco supports reversing this disastrous decision and returning control to small businesses.
Pass Tax Reform

Marco has a comprehensive tax reform plan that will cut taxes for working Americans, jumpstart investment, and slash corporate taxes to boost wages.

The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that it will raise wages for all taxpayers and create millions of jobs. Read more about the plan here.

Protect the Sharing Economy

Marco will oppose harmful new mandates, regulations, and taxes that can get in the way of innovative work opportunities provided by the sharing economy. Read more about that here.

Overhaul Higher Education

Marco proposes modernizing our outdated higher education system so that American workers can get the skills they need at an affordable price and in ways compatible with other priorities. Read more about the proposals here.

Unleash American Energy Potential

Making the best use of America’s energy resources provides abundant opportunities for high-paying jobs, many of which don’t even require a college degree. Marco will lift the ban on crude oil exports, allow states to oversee energy production on federal lands, and more. Read about his energy plans here.

Limit Regulatory Overreach

Marco has proposed a national regulatory budget, which will set a limit on the costs that can be imposed by federal regulations overall and by rules from each federal agency. This will roll back regulators’ ability to strangle job creation and restore Congress’s ability to oversee regulation. Read more about the idea here.
