Taxes & Spending

As Governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes almost 100 times, balanced the budget every year, and left Arkansas with an almost $1 billion surplus.



As Governor, Mike Huckabee:

  The first Governor of Arkansas to pass a broad-based tax cut in the history of the state.


  Doubled the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, doubled the childcare tax credit, and eliminated the marriage penalty.


  Eliminated the capital gains tax on the sale of a home.


  Eliminated the state income tax for families below the poverty line.


  Reduced the capital gains tax for businesses and individuals.


  Indexed the income tax to protect people from paying higher taxes because of "bracket creep."


  Left the state with almost a $1 billion surplus - a state record.


  Urged that the surplus should go back to the taxpayers in the form of a rebate or tax cut.


Economy & Wages

  Average family income increased by over 50%.


  Cut welfare rolls by almost 50%.


Law And Order

Law and order has always been one of my top priorities. The two people in this country he values the most are soldiers and police officers, because they are the only thing standing between our freedom and total anarchy.



My record on law and order as Governor includes::

  A 20% drop in murders.


  Carrying out 16 executions.


  Denying over 85% of all commutation requests.


  Cracking down on methamphetamine labs, child abuse, and domestic battery.


Education

I believe education is a family function - not a federal function. I have a strong record of supporting local control over education, starting in the household.



As Governor, I:

  Protected the right of parents to home school their children.


  Appointed a former home schooling parent to the State Board of Education.


  Signed a much improved charter school bill, resulting in the creation of Arkansas' first ever charter schools.


  Issued a Home School Day proclamation.


Values

You will not find a stronger champion of the sanctity of human life, traditional marriage, and the family values we hold dear.



As Governor, I:

  Fought for life, family, marriage and religious liberty.


  Passed a ban on partial-birth abortion.


  Signed a statewide marriage protection bill into law.


  Passed a law requiring internet filters in public schools.

Abolishing the IRS — FairTax

Americans spend upwards of $1 trillion each year complying with our 75,000-page tax code that is so confusing and complex, our government cannot explain it.

Instead of tinkering with the tax code, we need a tax revolution that helps every hard-working American and eliminates the IRS once and for all.

Abolish the IRS. Help me pass the Fair Tax.

We need the FairTax.

  The FairTax brings trillions of dollars in offshore investment and manufacturing back to the United States - creating millions of good jobs for American workers.


  The FairTax is the only plan that lowers everyone's tax rates, untaxes the poor, broadens the tax base, and helps protect Social Security and Medicare.


  The FairTax is the only plan that guarantees criminals, illegal immigrants, and all who operate in the underground economy pay their fair share - not just hard working Americans who play by the rules.


  The FairTax is the only plan that guarantees Washington bureaucrats don't have access to your personal financial information.


I cut taxes nearly 100 times as governor, including the first broad-based tax cut in the history of my state. It’s time for Washington to wake-up because America’s tax system is badly broken and beyond repair.

Israel — Our Friend & Ally

In a world of uncertainty, evil, and moral insanity, Israel is a shining light of moral clarity. The enemies of Israel are the enemies of America.

Sadly, this Administration spends more time berating Israel for building houses in the lands given to Abraham than telling the Iranians to stop building bombs pointed at us.



As President, I will:

  Stand with the Jewish people in our shared fight against
Radical Islam.


  Support a unified Jerusalem.


  Confront and stop Iran—this Administration’s willingness to trust Iran and undermine Israel is unprecedented and wrong.


  Support Israel in the fight for peace, religious freedom, and human rights.

America’s Heroes — Our Veterans

My first act as President will be to end the national disgrace of failing to properly care for veterans who sacrificed so greatly for our country.

America’s soldiers deserve first-class treatment and top-quality care — anything less is unfair, unacceptable, and simply un-American.



As President, I will:

  Fix the VA and give our heroes greater choices. We must hold VA hospital officials and government bureaucrats accountable.


  Solve the disability claims crisis and inexcusable wait times.


  Empower our veterans with permanent careers, purpose, and a growing economy — not temporary programs or government gimmicks.


  Fight for mental health awareness, treatment, and suicide prevention.


Priorities matter — our nation must make sure the first fruits of our treasury go to those serving in uniform.

Energy Independence

We shouldn’t import from our enemies basic necessities we can produce ourselves. A country that can’t feed itself, fuel itself, or fight for itself can never truly be free.

Let’s put American workers back to work, build our economy, and restore our nation’s security with American-made, homegrown energy.

I believe in self-reliance. We have hundreds of years of available energy underneath our feet and all around us. We can power ourselves out of this deep economic hole with common sense energy independence.

Partisan politics has kept us from Arctic exploration, energy opportunities along the Outer Continental Shelf, building the Keystone pipeline, and new sources of natural gas. Wind, solar, and renewable energy have great potential, occur naturally, and flow from inexhaustible sources.

We should explore and exploit all forms of domestically produced energy — oil, gas, wind, solar, bio-fuels, hydro-electric, nuclear, coal — anything and everything.

Washington’s Reckless Spending

The Obama Administration has saddled Americans with trillions and trillions in new government debt. Enough is enough.



As President, I will:

  Reject the failed Obama-Clinton policies that punish working families and encourage government dependency.


  Secure the border & end illegal immigration.


  Repeal & replace ObamaCare.


As Governor, I could not simply print money — I balanced the budget ten years in a row. I will take that experience to the White House and rein-in Washington’s reckless, runaway spending.

Protecting America From Enemies & Evil

From Christian decapitations to radical Islamist victory marches, crisis and chaos is erupting across the world. The Obama Administration lacks moral clarity and common sense.

We must:

  Rebuild America’s military superiority. The best way to avoid conflict is to build a lethal fighting force so strong and powerful that no one would dare mess with us.


  Restore our role as leader of the Free World. Our enemies no longer fear us and our allies no longer trust or respect us.


  Reject Obama’s crisis-management approach to the world. We need a President who will accept responsibility and lead.


  As President, I will lead with moral clarity in a dangerous world. Moral clarity is the foundation to our economic and military strength.


There is a difference between right and wrong, good and evil. I will keep all options on the table in order to defeat the evil forces of Radical Islam.

No summer vacation for Congress until the Iran deal is killed. Co-Sign Mike's letter today.

Fighting for Seniors, Social Security & Medicare

Social Security and Medicare are not voluntary programs. They are based on involuntary confiscation from every paycheck with the promise that people will receive benefits when they retire. The government does enough lying and stealing. It shouldn’t play people for chumps by taking money from workers for 50 years and then fail to uphold its promise. These are earned benefits.



  We must repeal and replace Obamacare, which robbed $700 billion from Medicare.


  Robbing people of the benefits they have contributed is not a solution — it’s an escape.


  20 percent of Medicare spending is waste, fraud and abuse. We must protect Medicare and prosecute fraud.


  We must grow the economy and ensure everyone is paying into the system.


As President, I will protect Social Security and Medicare. I will kill anything that poses a threat to the promises we have made to America’s seniors.

Repealing ObamaCare — REAL Health Care Reform

ObamaCare is a $2.2 trillion disaster that dumps millions of people into a broken, expensive system and does nothing to fix the basic problems everyday Americans face.



  We must tackle out-of-control costs.


  ObamaCare raided $700 billion from Medicare. This is not reform — it’s theft.


  We must reject government dependency.


  We need solutions and choices — not government mandates and new taxes.


  We must address pre-existing conditions with common sense.


As a governor, I know these issues first hand. Our system of “sick care” is upside down. Doctors, hospitals and drug companies get paid for treating people who are sick — not keeping people healthy or preventing illnesses. So many Americans cannot afford to get sick, while others take advantage of a system that isn’t fair.

ObamaCare simply doubles down on this backwards, broken, flawed and failing system. We need honesty, leadership and real reform. As President, I will repeal ObamaCare and fight for real health care reform.

Common Sense Education

When it comes to education, the Obama Administration is lost at sea. We must shift power back to state and local governments. In my ten years as governor, I fought for parents, students and local control.



  Washington bureaucrats and big-government central planners are out-of-control.


  Education is a family function — not a federal function.


  Education decisions are best made by the most local government — Moms and Dads.


I believe we must demand results, accountability and success for every child in every classroom. I oppose watering down our education standards or automatically promoting every student.

I also oppose Common Core and believe we should abolish the federal department of education. We must kill Common Core and restore common sense.

The rising cost of college also threatens middle class families, students and the American dream. For too many, college is where students discover mountains of debt — but not a lifelong career. We must tackle the establishment and reform our colleges and universities so they make sense for the jobs of tomorrow.

Immigration & Border Security

America has an immigration crisis on its hands, and it’s time for the federal government to do its job. Without a secure border, nothing matters.

We have drug cartels running reckless on our southern border, and the Washington establishment wants to reward illegal immigrants with amnesty and citizenship.

As President, I will:

  Reject President Obama's unconstitutional executive orders.


  Oppose amnesty.


  Secure the border now.
If you reward people who play outside the rules and punish people who live within the rules, pretty soon nobody is going to play by the rules. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.

  Endorse my plan to end illegal immigration.

Firearms, Freedom & the Second Amendment

The Second Amendment is the last line of defense against tyranny and must be protected.

I was the first governor in America to have a concealed handgun license, and I’m a lifetime member of the NRA.

As President, I will:

  Defend the 2nd Amendment

  Oppose new gun control laws

  Protect the rights of gun owners from Big Government

  Oppose new gun restrictions, registrations, regulations & mandates

This issue is crystal clear. Abolishing guns because of reckless abusers makes as much sense as abolishing cars because some people drive drunk.

I’m a lifelong deer, duck, turkey, and pheasant hunter. But the Second Amendment isn’t about hunting — it’s about preserving all the rights we possess as American citizens. Washington needs to understand this basic truth.


I, Mike Huckabee, pledge allegiance to God, the Constitution, and the citizens of the United States:
  As President I will defend our 2nd Amendment rights and oppose gun control legislation.

Life, Marriage & Family — Our Values

We’ve abandoned the building blocks of civilization. Life, marriage and family issues aren’t bargaining chips or political considerations. They are moral issues.

I will never apologize for my faith, my convictions or my values. Period.

Life begins at conception. This isn’t just a Biblical view — it’s affirmed by modern science and every unique human DNA schedule, which is present at conception.

As Governor, I promoted and signed a fetal protection act. I imposed a ban on partial birth abortion, established waiting periods, created parental notification requirements, and passed a bill so mothers who brought a newborn to a hospital or fire station would not be prosecuted for child abandonment.

I may stand alone, but I am absolutely faithful to the issue of marriage. Not because it’s politically expedient, but because it’s the Biblical position, the historical position and the right position. We must defend, protect and preserve traditional marriage.
