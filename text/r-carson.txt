Protecting Innocent Life
I am unabashedly and entirely pro-life. Human life begins at conception and innocent life must be protected.

Protecting innocent life
As a pediatric neurosurgeon, I took the Hippocratic Oath to “First, Do No Harm.” My medical career was devoted to protecting and enhancing the lives of children and their families. Protecting innocent life is a duty consistent with that solemn oath.

As a surgeon, I have operated on infants pre-birth. I can assure you that they are very much alive.

My commitment to protect innocent life goes back decades. For years I have helped raise money for a wide spectrum of faith-based entities that assist expectant mothers with the birth of their child by providing a variety of valuable, pro-life services.

Balanced Budget Amendment
In January 2009, our public debt was $11.9 trillion. Now, it’s more than $18 trillion. Interest payments on the debt now total about $250 billion, the 3rd single biggest item in the federal budget.

balanced-budget
We must ratify a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution in order to restore fiscal responsibility to the federal government’s budget.

The career politicians in Washington have demonstrated beyond even a shadow of a doubt that they won’t get serious about balancing the budget and paying down the debt until we MANDATE that it be done by constitutional amendment.

Each generation’s greatest responsibility is to pass on a greater opportunity to the next generation. Our generation is failing in this regard. A Balanced Budget Amendment to our Constitution will lead to a better future for our grandchildren.

Education
Education is the fundamental principle of what makes America a success. It is the foundation of what truly makes our country “the Land of Opportunity.”

Facebook sharingTwitter sharing
Education
For primary and secondary education, the bedrock concept that has always guided us has been “local control.” Communities fund and manage public schools for the benefit of families and children in their neighborhoods.

More than most, I’m acutely aware of education being the ladder that can lead one out of poverty and into realizing the American Dream.

In recent years, there has been a troubling trend of the U.S. Department of Education increasingly trying to dictate how children are educated in our primary and secondary schools. This must stop and Common Core must be overturned.

Our education system must be run by involved parents and engaged teachers and principals. Any attempt by faceless federal bureaucrats to take over our local schools must be defeated.

Health Care
ObamaCare is a looming disaster.

Facebook sharingTwitter sharing
Health care
We didn’t need the monstrosity of the $1.2 trillion Affordable Care Act. Even after it is fully implemented for 10 years, 23 million people still won’t have any health insurance.

We need to re-establish a strong and direct relationship between patients and their physicians. For instance, I strongly support Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) which empower families to make their own decisions about their medical treatment. HSAs will also drive down health care costs while protecting patient choice and freedom.

More freedom and less government in our health care system will mean lower costs, more access, and continued innovation.

Keep Faith in Our Society
Our Founding Fathers were courageous men of principle and faith. We know this because the Declaration of Independence, our bedrock document, explicitly acknowledges the existence of our Creator.

Facebook sharingTwitter sharing
Keeping faith in our society
The United States of America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. We can and should be proud of that fact. It served us well for almost 200 years.

However, we need to reverse the recent trend of secular progressives using activist, federal judges to drive faith out of our society. Anyone who wishes to practice their faith, for example by praying privately, can and should be able to do so. Equally, the rights of someone to abstain from private prayer should also be jealously protected.

The First Amendment enshrines our freedom to practice whatever faith we choose from any government intrusion. Our Founding Fathers never meant for the First Amendment to be used to drive prayer out of the public square.

Russia and Lessons Learned
Vladimir Putin’s Russia has become dangerously belligerent. It is actively destabilizing Ukraine, endangering Europe in the process and continuing to fuel destabilization in the Middle East. This newfound aggressiveness is a rising threat to the peace and security of the American people.

Facebook sharingTwitter sharing
Russia
The United States must be resolute in the face of these Russian transgressions. We must lead our allies, both NATO and non-NATO alike, from a position of strength.

History has painfully taught us that letting dictators run amok and hoping for the best fails.

President Putin must come to learn that there will be grave and serious consequences when Russia engages in naked aggression against other sovereign nations and free peoples. All options should remain on the table when dealing with international bullies such as President Putin.

Second Amendment
It was no accident that our Founding Fathers enshrined the right to own firearms as the 2nd element of the Bill of Rights, immediately after establishing our free speech rights. I cannot and will not support any efforts to weaken The 2nd Amendment.

It is too long, too complex, too burdensome, and too riddled with tax shelters and loopholes that benefit only a few at the direct expense of the many.
